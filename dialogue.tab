satend_kris_993900ea	k	Mmm. Quite simple, Doctor.	game/story/weekend/saturdayend.rpy	86	k "[what]"
satend_kris_b4b0beab	k	You're incredibly intriguing. I don't get to know much about you in our day-to-day.	game/story/weekend/saturdayend.rpy	87	k "[what]"
satend_kris_fd6581c7	k	Plus, it's not like we have much time to chat throughout the week, given your busy schedule.	game/story/weekend/saturdayend.rpy	88	k "[what]"

satend_kris_cb7cf481	k	I'm sure. It must be nice to have a break from that fast-paced environment.	game/story/weekend/saturdayend.rpy	101	k "[what]"
satend_kris_6cba1464	mc	Yes, but Miss Esther still keeps me moving.	game/story/weekend/saturdayend.rpy	103	mc "[what]"
satend_kris_f2bb35f8	k	She was like that with the last employee, as well.	game/story/weekend/saturdayend.rpy	105	k "[what]"

satend_kris_64ec4c87	mc	Swimming pool?!	game/story/weekend/saturdayend.rpy	115	mc "[what]"
satend_kris_ba91d6ba	k	Yes. It's been shut down since she left... I believe they drained all the water, as well.	game/story/weekend/saturdayend.rpy	117	k "[what]"
satend_kris_7cafccd8	k	It's a shame, really. She was very polite.	game/story/weekend/saturdayend.rpy	118	k "[what]"
satend_kris_35a72f19	mc	Interesting.	game/story/weekend/saturdayend.rpy	119	mc "[what]"

satend_kris_c0807d73	k	Now. I believe my systems are malfunctioning, so I should be going.	game/story/weekend/saturdayend.rpy	138	k "[what]"
satend_kris_4652aeae	k	I need to check my coolant levels. I think I'm overheating.	game/story/weekend/saturdayend.rpy	139	k "[what]"
satend_kris_1bf60051	mc	Of course.	game/story/weekend/saturdayend.rpy	140	mc "[what]"
