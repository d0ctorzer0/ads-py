day7esther_c09d884c	e	A robotic supervisor is fine, but apparently I'm not effective enough on my own.	game/story/weekend/sunday.rpy	228	e "[what]"
day7esther_35a72f19	mc	Interesting.	game/story/weekend/sunday.rpy	230	mc "[what]"
day7esther_9b5389bc	e	Thinking about it, though, we do sometimes tend to have a... bias towards members of our own species.	game/story/weekend/sunday.rpy	233	e "[what]"
day7esther_91720540	e	I suppose it only makes sense to have a robot-human team working together...	game/story/weekend/sunday.rpy	234	e "[what]"
