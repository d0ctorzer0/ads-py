Doctor.
I'm sure you're well aware of the warning I gave you a while back.
"Don't get too attached to the cores?"
"It won't end up well for you?"
Any of this ringing any bells?
Because you didn't heed my advice.
I have an obligation to Aperture. And, personally, I'd like to keep my job.
There is a very, very specific clause in my contract.
It tells me not to let any employee I supervise make a strong emotional connection with any of the cores in my section.
The clause prevents issues with HR.
Don't date your subordinates, doctor. It's as simple as that.
I mean, God, they're robots! We're robots!
There are SO MANY HUMANS you could have gone for instead!
But no.
You're just like the last employee.
What is WITH you humans and forming such strong emotional attachments?
To BARELY ANIMATE OBJECTS, mind you!
Oh well. It's none of my concern.
But you...
You make it to your room, change into your bedclothes, and prepare to sleep.
Tomorrow's the last day of the week, and maintenance doesn't work on the weekends, other than being on-call.
You're excited for your first day off, though a little curious what you'll do if you can't leave the campus.
Before you know it, you're fast asleep.
You wake with a start.
You think you were dreaming, but that's not possible in stasis.
You get up and check your wardrobe. What should you wear for Casual Friday?

You put on a regular old t-shirt and blue jeans, and head out the door to work.
You put on your best date-night attire, and head out the door to work.
You put on your vacation clothes, and head out the door to work.
You decide to just wear your uniform as regular, sling the lab coat over your shoulders, and head out the door to work.
Miss Esther is waiting for you patiently when you enter.
Ahh, Doctor. I see you went with the classic "casual" outfit today! Very nice.
Ahh, Doctor. "Casual" doesn't mean "black-tie event", but I suppose it works regardless. Dashing.
Ahh, Doctor! Planning on going on a cruise? Whatever that is...
Ahh, Doctor. Went the simple route I see? No worries. It's not for everyone.
Today's the last day of the week! Any exciting plans for the weekend?

There's plenty more to do around here than sit and read!
But it's your time off, so feel free to do whatever you wish.
Interesting. Well, it's your time off. You're free to do whatever you please.
Fair enough. I suppose you aren't used to being on-campus on your days off.
Well, we should be on our way, then. Grab your clipboard, and let's get going.
You get your paperwork and follow Miss Esther out the door.
You enter the conference room to find things much calmer than yesterday.
In fact, the screen that is usually moving so vibrantly and quickly is turned off.
Kris? Is something wrong?
Oh... Doctor.
You look... comfortable today.
You look... incredible today.
Uh... No. Nothing is wrong. Everything is alright.
Kris, your screen. It's off.
Yes, I'm aware. Financial thinks I... need to take a day away from it.
Why?
I'm not sure. Perhaps it has something to do with my... panicking yesterday.

Haha, I'm well aware.
I'm unsure exactly why they decided I needed a break, seeing as I don't work tomorrow regardless, but...
I suppose it's of no consequence.
The stock's back to normal after all...
Turns out it was a bug in the system. Go figure.
That's unfortunate, Kris. You were so worried.
Yes. Yes I was.
Uh, before you leave, Doctor...
You've been very kind to me this week. I'd just like to... extend my gratitude to you.
The man who worked your position before you, he...
Was not as... gentle as you are.
Thank you, Kris. You've been very kind yourself.
Again, I'm not sure. Perhaps that's the reasoning behind it.
Frankly, as I've told you before, I believe this is just another way to get us out of the picture...
Regardless. I won't complain about having a day off.
I just hope this doesn't become a theme.
As do I...
Sense? It makes no sense at all! In fact, the idea is frankly ridiculous.
I have been doing this for nearly 5 years now - almost half my lifespan!
I will not tolerate this disgrace to my intelligence...
You've been incredibly rude to me over the past week, Doctor...
I'm not sure what I did to upset you, but...
I don't appreciate it in the slightest.
I... should be going now. I have a schedule to keep.
Wow, I didn't even have to tell you to hurry it up this time...
You check Kris off your list for the last time this week and head out the door.
You enter into the break room. Heath isn't in the doorway this time - instead, she's waiting patiently up on the stage.
Doctor! Apologies for yesterday. Are you ready for yet another trick?
You hear what sounds like mechanics whirring, a puff of air, and then -
A cloth starts coming out of Heath's chassis. A load of differently-colored scarves.
Tada!
I don't see what the appeal of this "trick" is.
Just you wait, Miss Esther...
At least 10 meters of scarf has now exited Heath's chassis, and it's still going.
Cores aren't very large - a little bigger than a basketball, at most.
How she fit this much cloth into such a tiny compartment, let alone while avoiding her circuitry, and without hands...
You're not sure.
What the -
Finally, the cloth ends. In total, it's probably around 25 meters in length.

Why, a magician never reveals her secrets, Doctor.
It isn't easy, though, that's something I can guarantee!
That was very impressive, Heath. As usual.
Thank you, thank you, Doctor. Your applause is ALWAYS appreciated!
I'm not going to lie, Heath. That actually surprised me.
Ha! I even got ice queen Miss Esther to applaud me!
By the way, Doctor...
Thank you for being so kind to me this week.
I've never had such a captive audience before.
I hope you'll keep coming by to see me.
Don't worry, Heath. I will.
You've seen better?!
Ah, I suppose human magicians have more appendages to use...
No worries! I guarantee I'll get you next time!
Maybe...
Y'know, Doc... I've really tried this week...
Pulled out all the stops so you'd enjoy my performances.
I guess not every person likes magic, though.
Ah, yes. It should be fine - I've done this trick many times over.
Concerned about me, are you?
Why Doctor, if you're not careful...
Ugh. Heath...
Yes, yes, Miss Esther, haha.
Doctor, are you ready to head out?
Ah, yes, Miss Esther. Let's go.
Suddenly, a puff of smoke comes up from the stage. After you finish coughing, you look up to find...
...Heath has disappeared.
I swear, as much as I like her, that girl gets on my nerves sometimes...
You check Heath off your checklist once more and head out of the break room.
You begin to head up towards the greenhouse with Miss Esther.
So... tomorrow. What am I allowed to do on-campus when I'm not working, anyway?
Well, there's a few locations you wouldn't be allowed into.
Storage facilities, for one. Or anywhere in the residential block.
Other than your own room, of course!
You could always check out the sect below this one. I believe the relaxation center is down there... somewhere.
That's where they keep the test subjects in stasis, yes?
Yes, although I believe they've begun to phase that program out...
Don't quote me on that, though.
Oh! There's also a lounge down there, I believe. For the humans, after they get out of stasis.
I believe the new CEO installed that only recently, with the new funds Aperture's been pulling in.
Interesting. Manufacturing is also below us, I believe, but I've never heard of there being a lounge...
Manufacturing is quite large. Perhaps you've simply never encountered it.
We're here now. Go on in.
Doctor, Doctor, now's... really not a good time, haha...
You look around the room. It's darker than usual - not a good sign for an underground greenhouse.
Is something going on?
Ahh, yeah, kind of? Haha... the artificial sunlight, pumped in from the surface...
It turned off overnight. I'm not quite sure why.
When I got in this morning, things were completely dark... I had to quickly report the problem to Facilities so they could fix it.
Aspen is rushing from specimen to specimen as they speak to you, frantically checking their work.
I'm afraid it was too late. And now I'm just doing clean-up before night shift gets here...

Oh, no, Doctor, this is my job. Plus, you aren't cleared to work on this.
I appreciate it, though.
I've already sent an email to Facilities asking them to increase the sunlight output for a while, but...
...can you send them one as well? Your input might be more convincing for them.
I don't think they respect me very much...
Yes, I'll do that, Aspen.
Thank you, Doctor.
And... thank you. For your treatment of me this week.
You've been very respectful and, uh... very kind.
I'm not used to it. It's a little strange.
But thank you.
You're welcome, Aspen.
I should be going now. Good luck in here.
I'll make sure to send that email tonight.
Yes. I'll see you on Monday, Doctor.
Oh, that's funny - no, no. They look okay from the outside, but on the inside...
They're dying. Without the sunlight for that long, and this deep into the facility...
It's dangerous. We might lose half of these specimens because of this.
Well, you're the expert, I suppose.
Yes, I am, I guess.
You're a lot like the previous maintenance employee...
He didn't care much for botany, either.
It's alright, though. It's not for everyone.
I should be going now. Good luck in here.
Yes. I'll see you on Monday, Doctor.
Doctor, welcome back. Let's head back down.
You head toward the residential block with Miss Esther.
You turn to her.
Miss Esther - you said you used to work in Testing? What was your job there?
Oh, haha, I forgot I told you that...
Yes, I was a research assistant. I helped oversee the subjects we tested on.
Unfortunately, Testing underwent budget cuts... that funding went toward "employee satisfaction" or some nonsense.
After that, a lot of personality cores were phased out of the department...
Given new titles... I'm a Supervisor Core now, for example.
Interesting. Part of the new CEO's ideal, I assume?
Most of the recent changes are exactly that.
I don't doubt her, though. She has done plenty good for Aperture.
I see.
You turn to her.
So... have you always worked in maintenance?
Mmm... no. I was a research assistant in the Testing department, when it was still at its peak.
Testing?! That's a high-level department! And they threw you down here?
Yes, but they did give me a supervisor title, so...
I suppose I can't complain too much.
You reach CC's room. Standing outside the door, you can hear muffled talking.
Is someone in there with him?
There shouldn't be anyone in there at this time -
Doctor, open the door. Carefully.
You do exactly that.
I ain't doin' anything wrong, here, am I?
Technically, you are. This is a private room. You're invading my space.
But the Doc's in here. And her little friend.
Who are you calling "little"?!
Doctor, can you please remove this core from my room?
I have nothing against him, but he is trespassing.

Fine, fine, I'm leavin'.
None of you even give a rat's ass about me...
Obviously.
You're usually pretty... soft to me, Doc. I'm sure this is a one-off.
I'll see ya... this weekend, right?
And with that, he leaves.
Seems no matter how hard I try, you simply ain't interested, Doc.
S'fine. But I take back my invite for this weekend...
And with that, he leaves.
And with that, he leaves.
S'pretty simple, honest. I thought this was my own room...
The "place" you keep inviting me back to?
Yeah, exactly that. And I don't quite remember why I thought this was my room, but...
I sympathize, sir, I really do, but this is technically a research area.
You can't just go rolling into every room you see.
Aspen told me you've rammed into the greenhouse door before as well.
Oh, so this is a recurring problem?
Doctor, I suggest we escalate this to Encoding. There seems to be something horribly wrong with this... "core."
Now wait a moment, Miss Esther. I don't think that's necessary.
I don't know your name, or your job, or your designation...
But you need to watch where you're going.
My first day here, you nearly ran into Miss Esther.
And she's right - if this continues to be a problem, I'll have to report it.
I don't want to do that.
Yeah...
Yeah, I understand, Doc.
I apologize, uh... CC, right?
Haha. Yes, that's my name.
You're forgiven.
I'll get goin' now, Doc.
You've been unusually, uh, patient with me this week.
I do reckon you'll visit me tomorrow. Hopefully.
And with that, he leaves.
Uhh... Doc, I wanna apologize to you too, for uh...
Tryin' so hard. Pushin' you too much.
I take back my invite for t'morrow. You don't gotta come.
And with that, he leaves.
I reckon I oughta be goin', then.
See y'all.
And with that, he leaves.
Ahh. Thank you, Doctor.
Are you alright, CC?
Yes, Miss Esther.
He was not a bother. Simply breaking the rules - that was all.
I honestly regret he could not stay. I enjoy any company, regardless of the type.
How are you feeling today?
The same as usual, I would say.
Maybe a little better?
You turn to Miss Esther.
Is that a good thing?
For him, yes. For us, no. A "positive" report on CC is either one where his condition has not changed or has worsened.

Haha... excuse my language, but...
Aperture bastards, that's who.
Can't leave well enough alone...
Test, test, test, that's all they do...
Now, CC, calm down. Don't get too stressed. It's bad for you.
Well then. If it's bad for me, I should keep it up, yes?
Give those idiot scientists what they want...
Ahem. Apologies, Doctor, I believe I may have gotten... out of hand, there.
Before you go...
You have been incredibly kind to me, despite that not being necessary.
I will not forget that.
Thank you, CC.
Before you go...
I'm not sure what the issue is, but...
It seems you don't like me very much, Doctor.
That's alright though. That's a common occurence.
CC -
You should be going, now. You've been here far longer than your scheduled time.
Yes.
You finish your report and quietly leave the room.
Most likely not.
As you approach the door to the gym, you notice a surprising lack of yelling from inside it.
Rob's surprisingly quiet today. I don't hear the television active, either.
Hmm...
You open the door carefully.
Rob is sound asleep at his desk.
You've got to be kidding me.
The TV above him is turned off, as well.
There's no one else in here, though by now that seems to be the default state of things.
ROB! WAKE YOUR SORRY ASS UP!
Oh! Shit! Essie!
Sorry, I... uh.
You were SLEEPING? Do you realize we have to report this now?
Why I never...
Look! Look, I'm sorry, Essie. It gets boring as hell in here sometimes...
And I got no games to watch on Fridays 'cuz they redirect my electricity to hold meetings upstairs!
So I fell asleep. What's the big deal?

Not doing my job?!
All I do is sit here and watch the TV all day!
What "job" do I even do?! Hahaha...
I swear!! I'm alone in here all day, no one comes into this goddamn gym, and -
I DO NOT CARE! Your JOB is to watch and maintain the company gym. SLEEPING prevents you from doing that!
Do NOT talk back to the Doctor. They are your supervisor.
This is ridiculous, Rob.
Yeah, yeah. Whatever.
Now. If you're awake, the Doctor and I need to get going.
Sure.
Doc, listen...
You've been takin' me seriously. Not a lot of other doctors do that.
Sorry I fell asleep today. Won't happen again.
No problem, Rob.
I don't know what your problem is, Doc, but...
The way you talked to me this past week, I...
I dunno.
See ya.
Ahh, yeah. I suppose I shouldn't have dozed off like that.
It just gets real boring, y'know? Hardly anyone comes in here.
And they've recently started shutting off my electricity on Fridays for meetings, so I don't got any TV at the moment.
Yeah, I understand.
But I have to report this if it happens again.
I get it, Doc. Thanks.
Now. If you're awake, the Doctor and I need to get going.
Sure.
Doc, listen...
You've been takin' me seriously. Not a lot of other doctors do that.
And you've been nice. On top of that. So... thanks, yeah?
No prob, Rob.
But... I really don't know how to feel about you yet.
Seems you're flip-floppin'. Gotta make up your mind.
See ya.
Well, we have to report this. You sleeping is you not doing your job...
Regardless of the reasons behind it.
And frankly, maybe you'll take it in stride. Do your work, Rob.
Hmm. Yes'm.
Now. If you're awake, the Doctor and I need to get going.
Sure.
Doc, listen...
You've been takin' me seriously. Not a lot of other doctors do that.
So... thanks, yeah?
No problem, Rob.
Doc, listen.
It seems you don't really care for me, or the gym, or any of that shit.
That's alright, but... don't think I don't know that, yeah?
Yeah. Got it.
You end the day with your final checkmark of the week and head back towards your office.
You end your day with a note by Rob's name - "(sleeping)". You head back towards your office.
Alright, Doctor, I believe that's all!
You may have some end-of-week emails to go through, though. Other than that...
I'll see you on Monday!
Thank you for all your help, Miss Esther.
You're welcome. It's my job, after all.
DAY 1 - MONDAY. Soft lo-fi music begins to play. The scene opens on a bleak white office, with a big window on the left lighting the room.
You sigh. Another day, another dollar. But today's gonna be different.
An issue in another department has forced you to take over another employee's position for a few days.
What a downgrade... from manufacturing to maintenance...
As you carry your box to your new temporary desk, you check out your surroundings.
It's a lot different from the development level. Less messy, for sure. There's no bits of machinery strewn about the floor, no blueprints and plans sprawled across the desks.
It's a little unsettling.
You reach your new "headquarters." On the edge of the desk, there's a nametag.
The tag has "[name]" drawn on it in very hasty handwriting.
Well, at least they tried to be welcoming.
Suddenly, you hear the unmistakable sound of a personality core on a management rail. You turn to your right to see a bright, pink-eyed core zooming toward you.
Miss Esther enters into frame - a spherical robot with a white hull and pink handlebars. Her optic matches her handles, with one bright pink eye.
Why, hello there. I'm Miss Esther. I'm assuming you're the temp replacement for our missing employee, correct?

No, Miss Esther.
Oh no, I meant -
Oh! Yes, yes, my mistake. You were asking me what I meant by "missing employee".
You must have not heard, then. The employee who held this position hasn't shown up for a week.
No, I didn't hear anything about that. They just told me they needed a position filled until they could find a replacement.
Well it's of no real concern, darling. People disappear from here all the time, after all.
You're here now, so...
That's perfect. Go ahead and get your new desk set up while I go through our itinerary for today.
You begin unloading your box. You leave a space on the corner for your most prized possession...

You set down Bertha and pat down her soil slightly. She somehow survives, even with the lack of real sunlight this far down.
You place the ball carefully on a round stand so that the autograph is facing toward you.
You place the picture down gently and turn it slightly towards you.
Alright. Your job is simple.
We will tour Section C8 of the facility - that's the section you're overseeing - and ensure that all Aperture Science Personality constructs are functioning properly.
"Please ensure that the employee does not-"
Oh, sorry! That's for my eyes only. Whoops, haha.
We have five stops for today. And for... everyday, actually. It's the same route almost every morning.
Great, routine.
Check-up number 1...
Ugh. It's Kris.
What's wrong with Kris?
Nothing. He's just... you'll see. Come along.
The scene fades to a conference room.
As you enter the room of your first checkup, you look up at the wall in front of you to see a stock market display. Green and red lines dance across the screen rapidly.
In the corner of the room, intensely staring at the wall and muttering to itself, is a core, hanging by a management rail that looks like it hasn't been used in ages.
Ahem. Kris.
The core, startled by your entrance, spins around rapidly.
Kris comes into frame - though similar in appearance to Miss Esther, his primary color is a bright teal. He wears a bowtie below his eye and his handlebars are covered in fur.
Ahh, Miss Esther. I assume you're here for my checkup?
I'm here for no such thing. They, however...
Kris turns down to face you.
A new employee? Hmm. Interesting. A replacement already...
He scrutinizes you.
A little plain, isn't it?
Excuse me?
You. You're a little... boring, I suppose the word is.
Is he always this rude?
Esther sighs. You glance down at your clipboard.
I see here your job is to make sure Aperture stock doesn't get too low. Is that correct?
Yes, that's me. I'm constantly monitoring this board here.
I have stake in fifteen Fortune-500 companies, you know. I'm an expert in all things business.

Excuse me?! I don't appreciate your... implications.
Does this look easy to you? All these lines and colors and numbers??
Now, Kris. I'm sure they meant nothing by their comment.
Hmmph. Regardless, check me off your list. I'm doing everything I need to here.
Why... yes. It is quite hard.
Glad someone here has some common sense.
Esther scoffs. Kris pauses.
I apologise... for calling you... "boring".
Don't get me wrong, though. You could be doing a lot more.
You check "KRIS (BUSINESS CORE)" off your list. Seems like, despite the attitude, he does his job well enough.
Let's go, now. We have more to attend to.
I'll see you tomorrow, then.
I suppose so.
Miss Esther guides you out of the business sect and towards recreation. On your clipboard, it lists "HEATH" as your next checkup...
Our next check-up is close. Her name is Heath. She's... a little eccentric, but nowhere near as rude as Kris.
Eccentric? How so?
Just humor her, if you can.
Alright.
Miss Esther guides you into the next room, which holds a small stage with a closed curtain. Behind the drapes, you can hear crashing, banging, and...
Where is that goddamn rabbit?!
The unmistakable voice of a personality core.
Heath? Heath! It's time for your check-in.
Ah, shit. I'm on my way. One second. Is the human here yet?
Yes.
Oh. Pretend you didn't hear anything, hm?
Esther shakes her chassis in a sort of disappointed way.
Prepare yourself... for the great and amazing HEATH!
The curtains part and Heath enters the frame. Her purple handlebars are wrapped in yellow ribbon. Her optic has a purple spiral. She's a little larger than most cores.
The curtains part as a core with a purple optic and ribbon-wrapped handlebars comes barreling out. A flurry of confetti comes up from the floor and lands around it.
Mystery... intrigue... the unknown... what do all these things have in common?
ME, OF COURSE!
Are you ready for the most amazing trick you'll ever see in your feeble human existence?
Heath turns away temporarily, seemingly fiddling with something behind the curtain.
Suddenly, fire shoots up from the floor.
BOOM!! HAHA!! I just summoned FIRE with my MIND!!

Yes, thank you, thank you.
Haha!! I KNEW you had taste from the moment I laid eye on you!
I'm a true magician. It's in my wiring. And you SAW THAT!
That was inspiring, Heath. Amazing.
Mmhmm. Thank you, thank you. Not everyone appreciates my great talents.
Miss Esther groans.
You do this all day?
Yes! I'm the staff entertainer... it's my job to keep morale high and IMPRESS THE MASSES!
Well, you certainly impressed me.
Sorry to interrupt... this, but we do have more work to do...
O-Oh. I'm... the entertainer. I keep staff morale high.
I see. Is this how you achieve that?
Well, I would hope so. I'm the GREAT AND AMAZING Heath, after all.
You check "HEATH (MAGIC CORE)" off your list. Miss Esther was right - she certainly is eccentric, but morale seems high enough with her around.
Come back again tomorrow for another AMAZING SHOW!!
Haha, I certainly will!
We'll have to take a shortcut to the next location, as it's a bit far up.
Next on your clipboard is an "ASPEN".
The scene fades to a white hallway.
Miss Esther guides you to the next area, following you closely on her management rail.
Section C8 is mostly a recreational area.
Deep down in manufacturing and encoding, where you were, you might not have all the amenities afforded to more... surface-level scientists.
As she speaks, you look at your surroundings. You pass by a section labeled "RESIDENTIAL."
We have a residential section? Like, housing?
As I'm sure you're well aware, many of our staff resides on-campus in case of an emergency.
We'll pass through that area on our route, so you'll see it in a bit.
You'll also be assigned a room tonight. Maintenance staff is always on-call.
You groan.
Oh, hush. It's not all bad. Your sustenance is provided for you. We have a cafeteria, so there's no hunting required.
Sorry, hunting?
Why yes. Don't humans have to hunt for their food?
That was... hundreds of years ago. We have slaughterhouses and processing plants now.
Huh.
Suddenly, Miss Esther stops.
What the -
Coming towards her is a dirty, obviously-damaged core, not paying attention to where he's going.
Hey!
The core comes screeching to a halt.
A core comes into frame - several parts of his chassis are broken or cracked, and he's missing half a handlebar.
His entire body is stained brownish-yellow. A lighter fluid sticker is stuck to his plates.
Uhh... huh?
Who is your supervisor?!
This management rail is only approved for use by maintenance staff!!
Uhh, sorry, miss... ma'am. I don't rightly know how I... *hic* ...got here.
What is this... disgrace to my position!?

Yeah, calm down, lady. Issalright.
Are you lost?
Mmm, I guess I am, if I'm on an unapproved rail here.
Where were you headed?
Heheh, to your place, of course...
The core winks at you. Or... something adjacent to that, having only one eye.
Eugh. Disgusting. Vile.
Why don't you come drink some... *hic* lighter fluid with me, honey?
I'm... flattered, but I have to get back to work.
Your loss, but the invite's allllways available for such a pretty human...
Pfft. No. I'm... fit as a fiddle.
You have sparks flying out of you.
And what do you know?! You're just a lousy human!
EXCUSE ME, sir? This "human" has very important business to attend to and does not need the likes of YOU interrupting them.
Fine. Jesus, y'think people would have some manners...
The unnamed core spins around and hums happily to itself as it disappears back into the maze of rails behind the walls.
I have no idea why you even humoured such a... creature as that.
You shrug.
Miss Esther, visibly shaken (perhaps with anger, perhaps with confusion), continues slowly on her management rail.
Regardless. Our next stop is the greenhouse.
Greenhouse? Why do we need a greenhouse down here?
Why do we--
She scoffs.
We test more than robots here, thank you very much. Botany is just as much science as any other path.
She continues to rant about botany's importance to Aperture as you approach an unusually well-lit room.
Once you reach the entrance to the greenhouse, Miss Esther stops you.
Due to the fragile nature of our greenery, I must remain here. Only approved spheres may go past this point, and I am not one.

Haha, yes, Doctor, I'll be fine. It won't be for long.
You enter the greenhouse and are almost instantly blinded by the bright lights above you.
You look around in shock. Hundreds of plants, including some specimens you've never seen, line the floors, the walls, and the ceiling.
In the back corner, a mossy, dirt-covered core sprays the greenery with what is most likely water.
Hello?
The core stops spraying, turns around in shock, and quickly zooms back over to the entrance.
Aspen comes into frame. Their entire chassis is covered in moss, and several vines wind around their handlebars. Their optic is a bright green.
Sorry, sorry, didn't see you there!
That's alright.
I'm assuming you're the temp for the maintenance position, yeah?
Yes, that's me. I've just come to check up on you.
Well, no need for concern. My sprinkler system's working great as always.
The day it fails will be a horrible day for Aperture!
They laugh nervously.

I certainly will.
Ah, yes, i-it is. I'm glad you can see that.
Are you the only one maintaining these specimens?
Oh, not at all. Well, kind of. We've got a few nanobots on the greenhouse staff.
And of course, the scientists. But I would say I definitely work the most.
Wow, that's awesome.
Haha. Thanks.
What? What do you mean?
I just don't see what use Aperture could have for botany.
Lots of things! They test on other organics before they ever test on themselves, you know. And there's some kinds of science that can only be done on plants.
Mmm. I guess so.
I'll be leaving now. I'm sure Miss Esther is waiting for me.
Alright. I'll see you tomorrow.
You check "ASPEN (BOTANICAL CORE)" off your list. Despite the rather unusual subsection they oversee, they seem content enough with it.
As you exit the greenhouse, Miss Esther greets you.
Glad to see you're back. We should move along - that... encounter earlier put us behind schedule.
You glance down. Next on your list is something simply labeled "CC".
Miss Esther guides you down the hall, slightly quicker than before.
Before we reach our next checkup, I have to warn you... it's a little strange.
All of them have been pretty strange.
Miss Esther laughs.
Yes, but... CC is different. Not eccentric or interesting... just a little sad.
What does CC stand for, anyway?
...You'll see.
The two of you approach a room that is definitely not very well-maintained. The door looks like it's barely hanging on, and the window is so dusty you can't see through it.
You open the door gently. Inside, hanging from the ceiling by a cut-off management rail, is a core.
The room looks almost like a hospital room, with a bed and a bunch of monitoring screens. It's lacking the IV bags and sterilized equipment, though.
CC, it's time for your checkup.
CC enters the frame. His chassis is dusty, and he has several tubes coming out of his sides. His accent colors are an indigo-blue hue. He looks incredibly tired.
Oh, what's the use? The diagnosis will be the same, regardless.
Yes, I know.
The core slowly opens its optic and turns to face you. It looks... tired, somehow.
Oh. This one's new, isn't it?
Yes. This is the new temp.
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with me? Haha...
The core laughs, then coughs harshly.
I have cancer.
You look at the core, then at Miss Esther, then back at the core again.
Sorry. What?
I know, it sounds ridiculous. A robot, having a human disease. But I do.
Isn't that impossible?
Everything Aperture does is impossible.
You're just here to ensure he's still sick.
That's... that's it? No job to do, no task to maintain? I'm just making sure he's suffering?
Yes.
Yes.

Are you sure you want to choose this option? It is unnecessarily cruel and horrible.
Don't ask me. Humans can be cruel. Especially... Aperture ones.
Yes. Horrible indeed.
Does that mean you're dying?
Haha... they aren't sure. That's what they're testing.
If they wanted to test... robotic disease, or whatever... why didn't they use one of the non-sentient machines?
Don't ask me. You humans are cruel.
Well. Maybe not all of you.
CC, get some rest. Doctor, we should be going, now.
I hope you feel better.
I won't.
That's what they said when they turned me on, too.
Well, at least this makes this part of the job easy.
You're still suffering, so... mission accomplished.
You're not like the... previous employee at all.
CC, get some rest.
You check "CC" off your list. So that's what the C's stand for...
The last name on your list is a "ROB".
You and Miss Esther leave CC's room and start heading back towards your office.
The nice thing about your route is that it circles back around to your desk, which helps prevent too much time wasted walking.
Yes, I can see how that would be useful.
Our final stop of the day is the company gym.
We have a gym?
Yes. Rarely used, but yes, we have one.
Suddenly, a strangely-shaped figure comes barreling around the corner on a cart. It's headed straight towards you.
Aah!! I'm so so sorry! Watch out watch out!!
You try to move in time, but it's too late. The cart crashes into you.
Thankfully it's extremely lightweight, and you don't fall over.
You look down at the cart to see what is very clearly three cores in a trench coat.
The one at the top has a bright yellow optic, but the other two are concealed by the brown coat.
Sorry, sorry. It's hard to control this thing.
Are you - are you alright?
Me? Why, y-yes, of course, why do you ask?
It just looks like there's three -
Whoops! Got to go!!
Late for a, um, very important meeting! Yes, that's it!
With a few clicks of what's probably some sort of control panel, the cart turns and speeds off past you.
What... what was that?
That... was Gregory. He's - or, they're... or, uh...
You know what? We have more important business. Come along!
Still left with more questions than answers, you follow Miss Esther.
Eventually, you approach a door with "GYM" written on it. Not a sign of any other human employees, though.
You open the door to see a core behind a desk, red pupil twitching as it watches a TV screen above it.
The room looks like your average gym - several machines and dumbells line the walls. Multiple TV screens hang above the machines.
GO! GO!! What are you DOING?! THROW IT!!
The screen seems to be playing back an old recording of an American football game.
The screen seems to be playing back a game of some kind, but you don't know enough about sports to tell which one.
Sorry, with you in a sec.
THROW THE GODDAMN BALL, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!
Rob, it's 3 minutes of your day. That's all we ask for every time we come by.
Yes, yes, Essie. One sec.
AHH, DAMN IT!! CAN'T YOU DO ONE GODDAMN THING RIGHT?
The core shakes his chassis.
Sorry, sorry, yeah, I'm here, I'm present.
We're here for your check-in.
Yea, that's what I figured. This the new temp?
Yes, that would be me. I'm assuming you're Rob?
At your service. I'm in charge of maintaining this here gym. If it was ever used...
Do you not get a lot of people in here?
Not really. Too busy with their fancy science to get some exercise in.

Yeah, I suppose so.
Keep it up.
Why, thank you. I try to keep in nice just in case someone needs it.
I do get the occasional customer, but it's only about once a week.
So I spend my shifts watching the game instead.
Sounds fun.
You should come try out the machines some time.
I just might.
It's still important. Not much time for saving the world when you're DEAD.
I don't think a lack of exercise will kill you-
It CAN! Trust me, I've seen it happen. Like those humans in the stasis pods right now.
They're gettin' no exercise while they're sleepin'. And when they wake up? They'll wither away.
You really shouldn't get him started. He likes to rant.
Just... slowly back away.
You check off "ROB (SPORTS CORE)" from your list. That's the whole route done!
As you and Miss Esther proceed back to the offices, she conrgatulates you on a job well-done.
Despite all the interruptions, you made it through your whole route. And in record time, too.
Certainly an interesting cast of characters.
Yes. They tend to throw the more... eccentric cores into recreation, so they're not managing critical systems.
That makes sense.
It'll be the same thing tomorrow, same route, same check-ins.
Remember to check your e-mail for any important information. I'll send you your room number and code now.
Have a good night. Rest well.
You put in the code to your room and enter it, dropping your paperwork on the floor.
You never expected Kris to act so... sensitively. It seemed almost out-of-character.
You're glad you spent the day with Heath. She kept you entertained.
You figure you learned more about botany today than you ever did in your schooling years.
CC's conversations can get very deep. It gave you a lot to think about.
You're exhausted from your shift today, much more than usual. But it feels good.
You wonder if maybe you should've done something different today, or asked Miss Esther to come with you despite management's wishes.
Regardless, you need your rest for tomorrow's shift. You change out of your work attire and lay down for stasis.
You wake up at 08:00 as usual, get dressed, and head out the door.
Miss Esther greets you at the door.
Hello, Doctor!
Hello, Miss Esther.
Are you ready for another day? We're back to our regular routine!
You're awfully cheery today.
Oh yes, I suppose I am. It's Thursday, which means we're more than halfway through the week!
I'm simply excited for the weekend.
What do you even do over the weekend, anyway?
I have hobbies! I do... things!
Anyways, we'd better be on our way to Kris. Saturday will come quicker than you expect! Let's go!
You glance at the picture of Multnomah Falls on your desk and remember what CC said yesterday.
 You decide to...
You pick up the picture and tuck it in with your paperwork.
You leave the picture on the desk. Maybe another day.
You follow Miss Esther out of the office and towards the conference room.
You enter the conference room to see Kris whizzing across his management rail, back and forth, rapidly.
The screen behind him has a lot more red on it than usual.
Kris, we're here for your...
No time to talk. I'm trying to find the source.
The source of what?
Can't you read? Our stock plummeted overnight. We've had no large experiments lately, no important investments to make...
It just doesn't make sense!

I've reported it to finanical already, left a note that it may have been a mistake, or something in Testing...
I've... done everything I have to. I've done my job.
I'm not sure why I'm still panicking.
Sorry, Doctor. I am... calmer now.
Woah, Kris. Take a breath. You're the senior officer in charge of watching the stock, right?
Yes. That's why -
That's why you'll be fine. This is your whole job. You've got this.
But first you need to slow down.
Yes. Yes... you're right, Doctor. I apologize.
That's interesting. Can you solve it?
It's not my JOB to solve it. My job is to WATCH the stock, nothing more, and report to Finanical when it drops below a certain threshold.
I've already reported it.
Then you've done all you can, yes?
I... suppose I have.
Then there's no reason to panic.
Yes. Yes... you're right, Doctor. I apologize.
Get a hold of yourself, Kris. This is highly unprofessional.
Excuse me?
You're running all over the place in a panic. This job is not a high-stress one. There is no reason to panic.
Yes, but I've just never seen such -
No excuses. Pull yourself together.
I - uh...
I didn't know that... side of you existed, haha...
I don't think I need to ask if you're doing your job.
Yes, he made it clear right away that he was.
And his rambling put us behind schedule, Doctor.
Oh. Yes. Sorry.
I'll... handle this. You should be on your way.
Thank you, Kris.
You head out the door and towards the break room.
Before you can enter the break room, Heath stops you at the door.
Ohh! Doctor! Haha, you're here early.
Actually, we're right on time.
Yes, yes, but, er... I'm not ready for you quite yet.
I'm not prepared! So, you, uh, need to wait.

Why yes! Yes I am! And I'm not ready yet, haha. So...
So you need us to wait.
Yes!! Yes, yes.
Heath, we do have a tight schedule.
We don't have a lot of time to wait.
No, Doctor, we can't really afford to wait.
Not even for a short while?
No. Kris already put us behind.
Oh yes, I understand. No, you have places to be.
No show today, then, Doctor! I'm sorry!
That's unfortunate.
I think you saw enough yesterday to make up for it, hopefully!
If not, well, I'll just have to do better next time! Hahaha!
Miss Esther looks at Heath suspiciously.
We should get going, Doctor. Just mark the second box on your checklist instead of the first.
You check off the box that says "PREVENTED FROM INVESTIGATION".
This isn't going to make her look bad, is it?
It shouldn't, but I'll leave a note just in case.
Come along now.
Oh yes, I understand. You have places to be.
You seemed so interested yesterday...
We should get going, doctor. Just mark the second box on your checklist instead of the first.
You check off the box that says "PREVENTED FROM INVESTIGATION".
This isn't going to make her look bad, is it?
It shouldn't, but I'll leave a note just in case.
Come along now.
You and Miss Esther exit the break room and begin heading toward the greenhouse.
You've been around the section enough now that Miss Esther doesn't have to lead you anymore.
Doctor...
Yes?
Are you... enjoying your time here?
What do you mean?
I understand your... regular routine is a lot more extensive than maintenance.
That's true. Manufacturing is difficult.

I see. Yes, it's probably what you're used to.
And I don't have to engage with so many... er, characters, either.
Very true.
Well, that's great!
I'm glad you've found a... place for you in maintenance, even if it's for a short time.
You approach the door to the greenhouse.
I'll wait out here as usual.
Go ahead.
Doctor! Good to see you.
How's your shift been?
Pretty much the same as usual.
That's better than "absolutely horrible, thanks Aspen," haha.
Everything alright in here? Sprinklers functioning as normal?
Yes, actually.
Things are even better now that you're here!
Ahem. Sprinklers functioning normally, all that, yes, yeah.
That's great.
You suddenly notice something a little concerning - the moss growing on Aspen is beginning to creep into their inner mechanisms.
This could be a maintenance issue.
Aspen, that moss on you...

Oh, this? It's just sphagnum moss. It really shouldn't be an issue.
Don't worry. It won't get into anything critical. My core systems are sealed in case something like that were to happen.
It's all under control! Haha.
I do appreciate you showing concern, though, Doctor.
Of course.
You should probably be going, now. Miss Esther is waiting.
Yes, you're right. I'll see you tomorrow?
Casual Friday! Yes, you'll see me.
Have a good day, Doctor.
You mark off your checklist and leave the greenhouse.
Miss Esther greets you outside the door.
Well now, checklist marked off, correct? Let's proceed.
The trip to CC's room is uneventful.
You contemplate how you're going to give your picture to him.
CC! Love, it's time for your check-in.
Ahh, Doctor. Welcome back.
I've brought something for you. After our conversation yesterday.
You have?
Yes.
He doesn't have hands to put the picture in, so instead you hold it up to his optic.
It's a picture of Multnomah Falls, in Oregon. I went there some time ago while I was visiting my family.
You brought this in... for me?
Well, yes. I figured you probably get tired of looking at the same old waterfalls, so here's a new one.
Haha... Thank you, Doctor. This means more than you think.
You're welcome, CC.
This is very sweet of you, Doctor.
Have there been any changes in your health?
Not that I'm aware of. I'm as sick as usual.
In fact, if anything, I feel worse than yesterday.

I suppose that is true, yes.
Your positive attitude is... refreshing.
I try to be positive. It's hard sometimes, though, I understand.
Quite.
Doctor, that's ridiculous. And rude.
I apologize. I just meant...
No, I understood what you meant. But you didn't have to say it aloud.
Uh... yes, ma'am.
No, Miss Esther. It's alright.
The doctor is correct. Aperture's energy is wasted on me.
I'm unsure as to why they bother.
CC, I'm afraid the Doctor and I are behind schedule. We should leave.
Yes, I understand.
I'll see you tomorrow, Doctor, yes?
Yes. You will.
Good.
You both leave CC behind and exit the room.
The gym isn't too far from CC's room, thankfully, and you make it there in no time.
Miss Esther is strangely quiet. And she was so chipper this morning...
Doc! Essie! Welcome back. I'd like ya to meet my friend here, Greg.
Oh... you're who he was talking about... haha.
Great. More disruptions.
Greg here's one-a-my best friends. He's technically not part of recreation, but who cares?
He also thinks he's one personality core even though he's actually three of 'em.
And they call me whack! Ha!
I-I-I don't know what he's talking about. I am one personality core.
Haha... who goes around... pretending to be three cores in one?
That's ridiculous! Right?

And I... should be going. I'll talk to you later, Rob!!
Haha. See. I knew you had common sense.
I was just talking to Rob about these "sports" he loves so much. Something surface humans do.
Surface humans?
Y'know, humans that live up on the surface. Some of the doctors here never leave.
Ah, I see.
Suddenly, Gregory's... "legs" wobble.
Oh! I need to, uh, go. I think I'm... malfunctioning.
That's not very nice... trench coats are stylish, okay?
And plus. Human fashion is an... interest of mine, kind of.
You wouldn't get that. You doctors... all you wear are those lab coats.
Suddenly, Gregory's... "legs" wobble.
Oh! I need to, uh, go. I think I'm... malfunctioning.
Gregory zooms away, gone as quickly as he came.
He's an interesting guy. I like him.
Reminds me of myself, in a way.
Anyway. The techs came by earlier today, fixed up that machine that was broken.
Don't know if it was you who put in the order, but thanks if so.
Oh, one second.
WHAT THE HELL IS YOUR PROBLEM? MOVE, DAVID, MOVE!
Sorry. He's a shitty receiver. Would be much better if they put him in literally any other position...
I have no idea what that means.
Neither do I.
Everything's alright in here then? Nothing else causing any problems?
Nope! Spic n' span, as per usual.
You must be pretty sore, though. Make sure you rest those muscles.
Aye aye, captain.
Sorry to interrupt, but it's almost shift-end, Doctor. We should leave.
Oh, yes. Absolutely.
You finish your checklist for the night, wave goodbye to Rob, and leave the gym.
Good shift today, Doctor. Tomorrow's Casual Friday. Wear whatever you feel is appropriate.
Just... try not to show too much skin.
Will do. Thank you, Miss Esther.
You arrive at your new quarters. They're humble, really only meant to house you while you sleep and no more.
You sigh.
What a weird first day...
You drop off your bag and lay down on your stasis chamber, which will wake you up in the morning.
You wonder if this thing actually makes sleep more efficient or not.
With that, you gently close your eyes.
You gently wake up and look at the clock. It's 08:00 on the dot.
Groaning, you get up and head towards your office.
Miss Esther isn't here yet. You organize your files while you wait.
Suddenly, there's a knock on the door.
Yes? Who is it?
I'm havin' some trouble here, can't seem to activate these here door mechanisms...
You get up and go over to the office entrance.

Well, y-yeah, but I was thinkin', y'know, you'd make an exception?
And why would I do that?
'Cuz I'm so charmin'?
And risk losing my job?
Alrigh', now, no need to get so serious on me...
Get out of here before Miss Esther comes and reprimands you.
I'm goin', I'm goin'.
You scoff and return back to your desk.
You unlock the door using the keypad, and a familiar face comes "stumbling" in.
Why hello there, pretty little thing.
What do you want?
I jus' wanted to come 'n say hi.
Oh, and also invite you out to my place after work, of course...
Haha, and why's that?
Well, s'not everyday now that a beautiful human like yourself shows their face 'round here.
I'm takin' a chance while I still got it, now.
I appreciate the gesture, but I'm very busy. I have a lot of work to get done.
Yea, yea, I know. You scientists are always busy.
The core glances around himself nervously.
Listen, I should scram 'fore that little pink core of yours shows up again.
Miss Esther, you mean?
Yeah, yeah, her. So. I'll send you a little message tonight.
Keep an eye on your inbox, yeah?
The core gave a little bow and exited the room.
If nothing else, he's certainly interesting...
You return back to your desk.
You stay quiet.
Uhhh... hello?
...
I swear I coulda heard you answer me. I know you're in there.
...
Or maybe not...
Maybe I'll try again later.
You hear the core zoom away from your door. You sigh.
You return to your desk.
Just as you sit back down, the door opens and Miss Esther comes barreling in extremely fast.
Sorry! Sorry I'm late! I got caught up in rail traffic...
She shakes her head.
You'd think with the increase in robots working at Aperture, they'd at least try to expand the rail system...
Regardless! Welcome back. Since we're a little behind, we should get started right away. Do you have everything you need?
Yes, I believe so.
Perfect. Come along, now.
You and Miss Esther approach the conference room, just as yesterday.
I know maintenance can be a tedious job, but don't get discouraged.
A lot of other employees in this department would kill to have a route like yours.
Especially considering the majority of personality cores aren't... great.
Why hello, and welcome back. I'm assuming your route went well yesterday if you're still here now.
I'd say so. Any changes in the stock today?
Not that I've seen, no. Ever since the new CEO took over, things have mostly been quiet.
She maintains the finance department well, then?
Yes, I'd say so. Smart one, that.

Is that so?
Why yes. I watch my spending carefully, especially after the turmoil the company recently went through.
Do you have any investments?
Of course. I'm not an idiot.
That's not what I was implying.
It's important to invest. I'm glad you see that.
What do you mean by that?
The former CEO. His reckless spending put the company deep in the gutter, from what I've been told.
I'm aware, but I don't like your tone.
Finances are not easy to manage.
The fact you think they are speaks measures about how well you truly manage your own.
We've really ought to be going, now.
I hope I'll see you tomorrow.
Miss Esther rolls her optic.
Yes, you have more to attend to.
You check Kris off your list and head out.
Heath likes to show a new "trick" every day, so don't be surprised if she tries to do one again.
Does she actually think what she does is "magic"?
I have no clue. I'm not particularly interested in... uh...
...getting to know any of them.
Why not?
"Connection"... it's just not my thing. I don't understand how you humans can do it.
You enter the stage room to find Heath already waiting for you.
Apologies for the delay yesterday, it won't happen again! I'm ready this time!
You wait with bated breath.
Now... choose a card... any card...
Well, any card that I have on me, preferably, but...

Oh. Yeah. You've got important science stuff to get to, huh?
Sorry. I just don't really like magic all too much.
That's alright.
You're doing everything you need to, yes? Keeping morale high and all that?
I think so.
Great.
Is THIS your card?
She pulls out exactly what you thought of - the three of clubs.
Wow! Yes, that's exactly it! Amazing.
Hahaha, thank you, thank you very much.
Miss Esther groans.
Is your morale improved? Your spirits lifted?
Definitely. And on top of that, I'm impressed, too.
O-Oh, really? It's nothing, honestly, haha.
Everything's alright here? Everything working fine?
Job's proceeding as normal. No complaints!
From me, or your coworkers! Haha!
Oh, um, actually, I don't have that card with me. Can you... choose again?
You check Heath off your list. Aspen is next.
I hope that disgusting core we saw yesterday doesn't make another appearance...
You and Miss Esther make your way over to the greenhouse.
She looks annoyed.

You decide to stay quiet. Eventually, you reach the greenhouse.
Go on, now.
You enter the greenhouse.
What's up, Miss Esther? Is something wrong?
Hmm? Oh, nothing, nothing. Just thinking about work.
Do you not like your job?
No, don't get me wrong, I do. It's just tedious.
I used to work in Testing, you know.
Testing?? That's, like, top-level work. Why'd they move you down here?
Budget cuts, basically. Testing isn't half the program it used to be.
Wayyy back in the early days of Aperture, from what I've heard, we used to test on olympians and astronauts and...
...y'know, the best of the best.
Then the 70's hit. And the funds started running low.
And...
Oh look, we're here. Go on in, now. I'm sure Aspen needs a check-up.
You decide not to question her further. You enter the greenhouse.
Once again, you are taken aback by the sheer number of plants in the greenhouse.
Aspen greets you happily.
Welcome back, welcome back.
Everything's still alright in here?
Yep! Pretty as a picture. No issues with my sprinkler, either.
How come I haven't seen any other humans in here?
They really only come in the evening to do their experiments.
Sometimes when I come in the next morning, plants are missing or mutated or...
...then there was that one time with the potato battery...

Yes, very busy. Thankfully, I love botany. And I love my job.
Well, you know what they say. If you love what you do, you'll never work a day in your life.
No, I didn't know that. But now I do! And I love that!
I should probably get going, now. Miss Esther's waiting.
Alrighty. Have a good day.
Children's toys?! Potato batteries are incredibly important to science, you know.
First of all... well, yes, they're good for teaching children. But on top of that!
It's a beautiful fusion of electronics and botany. Just like me.
Uh-huh.
You just don't get it. You're just like the last guy.
I should be going.
Yes. You should.
WHAT? No way! What type is she?
She's a snake plant named Bertha.
Snake plants? I think we had those a while back.
That's wonderful. How does she survive this far down? There's sunlight down in the offices?
I think they pump it in from the surface, like how they do in here.
That's amazing.
I should probably get going, now. Miss Esther's waiting.
Alrighty. Have a good day! Say hi to Bertha for me.
I will.
Haha. You're great. Better than the last guy.
What was wrong with the last guy?
He just... didn't really get it, y'know? Thought plants were stupid.
And me. He thought I was stupid, too.
That's horrible.
Tell me about it!
But you're here now, and you're so much better.
That's sweet of you.
Well... uh, ahem. You should get going. Miss Esther is waiting. Probably.
Yes. You're right.
You check Aspen off your list and exit the greenhouse.
I hope everything went well in there. We should get back on track towards CC, now.
Why is CC even alive?
What do you mean?
Sorry. Why did they make him? Or even... how?
I couldn't say. I'm not an expert on the way you humans think, but I have seen Aperture do many things over the years.
I'm still fairly sure we've got about 10,000 test subjects on ice in the basement, still.
Really? I thought that was just a myth.
You continue down the hallway towards CC. No interruptions so far...
Welcome back, Doctor. How have your rounds been?
They've been alright. Nothing crazy.
I'm glad. An easy day is a good day.
Are you still feeling... sick?
Haha. Yes.

I appreciate the offer, Doctor, but there's really nothing for me.
You could unplug me. That would kill me faster.
I'm afraid not, CC. Goes against our contract.
CC coughs harshly.
It's alright, I understand. Thank you, regardless.
Please let me know if there's anything I can do.
You check CC off your list and solemnly leave the room.
Let's go.
As you close the door to CC's room behind you, you glance around.
No sign of that strange figure from yesterday, thankfully.
Time for our last stop of the day.
It feels like this route's gone a lot quicker than yesterday's.
Yes, most likely because we haven't had any unnecessary interruptions.
The two of you head off towards the gym.
Welcome back, welcome back, doctor. Interested in a run on the treadmill today?
Maybe another time. Any visitors today?
Well, yes, actually - Dr. Pierce came in earlier today, said he had a dream he needed to exercise more? Or somethin'...
He's kind of crazy, not gonna lie.
Working in neurology will do that do a person.
I am having some trouble with my equipment, though. Rowing machine's busted.
Come to think of it, it was prolly busted yesterday and I just forgot to mention it.

Thanks. I'd do it myself, but, uh... I don't think I know how.
No issues.
Ahh, thank you. Sometimes it feels like half the machines in here are broke due to, uh, lack of use.
Rob suddenly looks at the screen above him.
AH, DAMN YOU! LOST THE BALL AGAIN?
You really like sports, don't you?
Uh, ahem, yeah. They keep me occupied.
Kinda need it with how lonely it gets in here.
Even when I do get visitors, they hardly ever talk to me...
Assholes.
Doctor, we really ought to be going.
Go on - I'll catch you later.
That's not very kind. Machines have feelings, too, y'know.
And I think I'd know! I AM one, after all.
I wasn't always a machine, though, I had limbs, once...
No he didn't. That's just a straight-up lie.
Rob, you were manufactured using melted-down turret panels and a lack of hope.
Whatever, Essie.
Rob turns to face you.
She's crazy.
Ugh. Let's go, Doctor.
You check Rob off your list once more to finish the day off.
As you leave the gym, Miss Esther turns to you as you begin walking back to your office.
Tomorrow's agenda will be slightly different, so just be prepared for a switch in the routine.
A switch in the routine? It's only the second day.
Yes, but even temps have to follow the maintenance schedule.
How will it be "different"?
I'll let you know tomorrow. For now, get some rest.
You make your way to your quarters. After organizing your paperwork, you lay down in your stasis chamber.
Before you fall asleep, you wonder what Miss Esther meant by tomorrow being "different".
You wake up, slowly but surely, and turn to the clock. 08:00, again.
Work in manufacturing doesn't begin until 11, and it's going to take a bit to get used to this new schedule.
You get up and go towards your office.
Miss Esther is here on time today, and greets you happily.
Hello, Doctor!
Hello, Miss Esther.
Today's agenda is very simple.
Once a week, the maintenance employee must spend one full shift with a core under their section, to ensure that work is actually getting done.
After all, they could just pretend to do their job when you come in, and completely ignore their responsibilities otherwise.
The core that gets overseen changes every week, so it keeps them on alert, so to speak.
I see. Makes sense.
In addition, I am not permitted to accompany you today. They'd like to see if you can handle the position without my supervision.
Miss Esther laughs.
I think that's ridiculous. Of course you can. I don't see why I shouldn't accompany you, but...
Policy, I suppose.
Anyway! Which core are you interested in overseeing today?


Ugh, that thing?
Unfortunately, I have no idea who he even is, much less what his job is.
I don't even know if he's a core in our section.
I have nothing in my database to allow you to oversee... that thing, so, no. Choose again.
Okay, then...
I'm afraid that Gregory isn't under our supervision. He's technically a Section C7 core, which puts him out of our scope of work.
I'm not even sure what his responsibilities are.
You'll have to pick somebody else.
Alright, then...
Really? That egotistic idiot?
I suppose it doesn't matter who you pick, as long as I can log it properly.
I'll put it in my database that you'll be supervising Kris today. Do you remember the way to the conference room?
Yes, I do.
Perfect. You should be on your way, then.
You enter the conference room to see Kris staring at the screen. You can't understand what's happening, but that's his job, not yours.
Kris?
Kris turns to face you, smug as ever.
Well, well. Miss Esther sent me a notification that you'd be overseeing my work today.
Yes, that's right.
Couldn't get enough of my charm, hmm?
Haha, very funny.
Be prepared for a long and boring shift. Watching a screen all day isn't all it's made out to be.

Me? Exciting? Well now. I try not to be too exciting.
Especially after the disaster that was our former management.
What was wrong with the former management?
Oh, that's right. Miss Esther did say you were a... newer employee.
You must not have been here when Mr. Johnson was still at the head of the company.
No, I wasn't. I was part of the first new hire wave about 9 months ago. But I've heard... stories about him.
Mr. Johnson was an... interesting man. You might hear some... lesser cores refer to him by his first name, "Cave".
I still have some semblance of respect for the man, regardless of his ridiculous financial policies.
He just... did not handle the company very well in terms of our monetary investments.
Were you working during the time?
In a way, yes. I was activated in 1979, but I was originally a consultant. As Mr. Johnson lost more and more employees due to mandatory testing, he began replacing them with... us.
That's why there's so many personality cores around now. We're... remnants.
The man never stopped spending Aperture's money. And it led him to his death.
You seem bitter about it, still.
Hmm. I suppose I am. I enjoyed my consulting work. After Miss Caroline took over as CEO, a lot of things happened.
Projects got shut down. Employees were fired. Personality cores became... less important.
The scene fades to Kris looking down solemnly.
I'm stubborn for that reason.
My job is... simple. Perhaps not every personality core can read a stock market graph, but... it's a useless job.
I think what you do is very important.
Not as important as it should be. Miss Caroline, she...
She doesn't trust us. And I'm not sure why.
She is excellent at what she does. She's dragged Aperture out of the ditch it was in, but...
The company now... it's different. Mr. Johnson was fascinated with us. Miss Caroline is not.
The screen fades back to normal.
But that's neither here nor there. I'm satisfied enough with the work I do, regardless of how inconsequential it is.
I see.
The rest of your shift is uneventful. Kris does his job well enough for your audit on him to pass.
He flirts with you a little. You feel your face flush.
When your shift is over, you wish it wasn't.
Ahh, it's 16:00. That's your clock-out time, correct?
Yes. I suppose it is.
Unfortunate. I enjoyed our time today.
Me too.
I'll see you tomorrow, yes?
Yes. You will.
You finish your checklist, and leave the conference room to head back to your office.
I see. Well then, I hope you brought some entertainment.
Kris turns back to the screen.
Though you try to make conversation with him to pass the time, he either ignores you or brushes you off.
Perhaps you shouldn't have dismissed him so easily.
The time ticks by incredibly slowly, and the graph doesn't change enough to entertain you.
Eventually, it's 16:00, and it's time for you to go.
You finish your checklist and leave the conference room without a word.
Well, if anything, at least you'll be entertained.
Truly, it doesn't matter who you pick, as long as they're in my systems.
I'll put it in my database that you'll be supervising Heath today. Do you remember the way to the break room?
Yes, I do.
Perfect. On your way, then.
You enter the empty break room cautiously. Heath is nowhere to be seen.
Heath? I'm here.
You hear her voice from behind the curtain.
Uh... yes, yes!! One minute, please. You got here faster than I thought...
The crashing and rattling taking place doesn't ease your conscience.
Suddenly, Heath whirls out with a puff of smoke, coughing.
Ahem. Uh. Sorry, I've been trying to get my next big performance ready.
It's not going so great.
But anyways! Welcome back! Good to see you.
Miss Esther told me you chose ME, of all cores, to oversee today.
Yes, that's right.
Well, you're in for a treat. My whole job is entertainment, so I'll be sure to keep you awake and aware!
Don't be surprised if I sweep you off your feet!

Oh, haha, that's not what I... expected you to say...
But I'd be thrilled to oblige!! Prepare for the show of your lifetime!
Heath goes back behind her curtain and begins mumbling to herself. Bowling pins and an 8-ball roll out.
You have no idea how she does magic without hands.
Heath?
Yes?
What's behind that curtain of yours, anyway?
Oh! Would you like to see?
Uhhh... sure, why not?
Heath parts the curtains.
You're stunned by what you see -
 - a hidden-away, wooden room, lined with fairy lights, shelves stocked with magic paraphenalia.
Tada!! This is my magic room. It's where I keep all the stuff I use to perform my tricks.
Wow, Heath. I can't believe this. It's amazing.
Yes, yes, I know.
There's my magic 8 ball, my stuffed rabbit, my bowling pins - for juggling.
You can juggle?
Hahaha, no. But you could!
I haven't shown anyone else this room, so you should consider yourself lucky!
Heath comes back out and closes the curtains.
Oh, just some miscellaneous props and such. Nothing too special.
Heath comes back out of the curtains. You try to get a peek at what's behind them, but it's no use.
The rest of the day is exciting. Heath keeps you entertained with plenty of tricks, all which leave you bewildered.
She somehow manages to pull off some of these better than the human magicians you know.
An occasional coworker comes into the break room and watches her, too. They don't seem as into it as they should be, you think.
You find her inspiring.
But every show must come to an end, and once hers does, you find yourself disappointed.
Thank you, Heath. This was great. I had an amazing time today watching you perform.
Thank you, thank you, Doctor. You're the most captive audience I've had in ages!
She gives you a bow as you finish your checklist and head back to your office.
I really haven't impressed you at all??
I don't even have hands! You're not impressed by that?
I don't know. I've seen crazier stuff happen at Aperture.
Oh.
The shift isn't very fun, after that. Heath tends to keep to herself.
The occasional coworker comes in, and she'll put on a show for them - but generally doesn't speak to you otherwise.
You think you offended her.
The time ticks by incredibly slowly.
Eventually, it's 16:00, and it's time for you to go.
You finish your checklist and leave.
Good choice. They're a nice kid.
I'm sure they'll appreciate the company.
I'll put it in my database that you'll be supervising Aspen today. Do you remember the way to the greenhouse?
Yes, I do.
Good. Off you go!
You enter the greenhouse. Aspen is humming quietly while they water the plants.
Aspen?
They jump and spin around rapidly.
Holy Aperture!! You scared me.
Sorry, sorry. Didn't mean to.
You're here early...
Oh! Today's the one-on-one observation day!
Yes, now I see the message Miss Esther sent me about you overseeing me today...
Sorry. I can get a little "in-the-zone" so to speak, when I'm working.
You're alright.
So wait, why'd you choose to supervise me? All I do is water plants all day.
I don't think the last guy ever chose me on his Wednesdays...

Oh! Well then, I'm happy to oblige. What are you interested in?
How many of you are in Botany?
Let me think...
I believe there's a total of 70 of us? Uh... the researchers, scientists... gardeners like me.
That's not a lot.
You're right - it's really not!
I kind of like it though. It keeps us accountable. If even one of us falters, the whole team will suffer.
That's a lot of pressure.
Tell me about it.
So, uh... do you have a favorite plant? Out of all of these?
Oh yes! Absolutely! Come over here, and I'll show you.
You follow Aspen on his management rail as he leads you to a back corner.
The screen fades to a close-up shot of Aspen looking down at a fern. The scene is softly lit and is mostly dark.
This is Penelope. She's an "Adiantum" - a maidenhair fern.
She's extremely tempermental. Doesn't listen to anyone but me.
I swear, if any other greenhouse employee tries to water her or test on her, she throws a fit.
Haha, not literally, of course. She'll just wilt. But she's my favourite.
She's beautiful.
Thank you. I know.
You suddenly realize how close you are to Aspen. They realize, too.
Oh! Ahem, uh, sorry. I was excited to show you my - uh... favorite plant.
No worries.
Oh, not really. I like all my plants equally.
Can't be picking favorites - what if it dies? Haha.
The rest of your shift is very informative.
Aspen spends their time watering the plants and rattling off botanical facts.
You learn more about botany than you ever thought you'd care to.
They seem to love their job.
You're happy for them.
Before you know it, it's 16:00 and time to go home.
You finish off your checklist and head out.
Oh... yeah. I suppose. All I do is water plants, after all.
The rest of your shift is easy, yes, but boring.
You spend most of your time sitting there while Aspen focuses whole-heartedly on their job.
You have no idea what to say to them.
Perhaps you shouldn't have been so harsh.
The time ticks by incredibly slowly. Eventually, it's 16:00, and it's time for you to go.
You finish your checklist and leave.
Yes. As long as they're along our usual route, yes.
I'm sure he'll appreciate the company.
I'll put it in my database that you'll be supervising CC today. Do you remember the way to his room?
Yes, I do.
Perfect. On your way, then!
You make your way into CC's "hospital" room. He is hanging in the same spot.
You believe he may be sleeping. Or something similar.
You gently poke his chassis.
CC?
Ahh, Doctor. Apologies, I was... trying to conserve my energy.
You need to conserve energy?
What're all these tubes and pumps for, then?
A multitude of things. A lot of them I'm not even sure of.
Oh, sorry - I just got a message from Miss Esther...
Oh.
Haha... you chose to supervise me today?
Well then...
You're going to be very bored.

I... interest you?
Haha. That's silly.
But it's...
...more than the last doctor said.
You know, you woke me up from my dream.
You can dream?
In a way, I suppose. Cores don't quite... "dream" the same way humans do, but... yes. We can visualize things.
What were you... visualizing... about?
The scene fades to CC looking down solemnly. He's back-lit by his window. In the foreground, you can see the computers that monitor his health.
Well... it's a little embarrassing.
See, I have so many bio-simulators and pain receptors stuffed into my chassis, it's like I'm practically organic.
And I've heard the scientists talk about these wondrous things called "waterfalls"...
They must be beautiful. Water falling so freely, no... tubes to tether it down, management rails to confine it...
I think about it a lot.
I would give anything to see one.
But I know I never will. So I look at pictures. And it's almost the same.
Nothing, really. Just wishing I was healthy.
I always dream about that.
The rest of the day is quiet, slow, but nice.
CC is more full of life than ever.
He talks about his daily routine. Asks you plenty of questions about your own life.
Your shift goes by quickly, and when it ends, you find you don't want to leave.
But 16:00 comes as always.
I need to get going, CC. But... this was nice. Relaxing.
Especially after the weirdly chaotic week I've had.
Yes. I understand. I'm glad I could give you a... break, sort of.
You finish your checklist and head out for the day.
Well, I guess we can both preserve our energy, then.
The rest of your shift is boring.
CC won't wake up no matter what you do, and it's nearly impossible to fall asleep in the hard chair you're in.
You end up trying to read the manual next to him, but it's full of technical jargon.
Even with all your experience in manufacturing, some of these terms still don't ring any bells.
Eventually, just as you're about to drift off, the clock hits 16:00, and it's time to go home.
You finish your checklist and quietly leave the room.
You want to supervise him? Well, don't let me stop you.
I'll put it in my database that you'll be supervising Robert today. Do you remember the way to the gym?
Yes, but - sorry, Robert?
His full name. He prefers to go by Rob, though, so... don't tell him I told you.
GO! GO! GO!!! COME ON, PUT YOUR BACK INTO IT!
You enter the gym and immediately spot Rob yelling at the screen in front of him.
CAN'T RUN TO SAVE YOUR GODDAMN LIFE! COME ON!!
Um... Rob?
Sorry, Doc. One second. The game's on.
He turns back to the screen just in time for -
TOUCHDOWN!! HELL YEAH!
The crowd on the screen goes wild, yelling and shouting. You forgot how big American football used to be.
The crowd on the screen goes wild, yelling and shouting. You assume this is a good thing, because Rob looks pleased.
Sorry, sorry, Doc. The game gets me excited. You should know this by now.
No worries.
I saw the message from Essie. You chose to supervise me today, huh?
Yes, that's right.
Well, that's perfect. Great time to get those muscles to work, now!

I'm surprised you even know the name of one of the machines.
Most of the doctors here don't care.
I do try to keep in shape a little bit, when I can. Usually on the weekends.
Well alright then! Elliptical's right over there. Feel free to use any of the machines.
Need a coach?
Sure. Why not?
Rob moves on his management rail over to the elliptical machine.
The scene fades to Rob looking down at you, "HANG IN THERE!" poster and TV screen behind him.
Alright, hop on, let's get started.
You begin your workout, and Rob coaches you on your form.
You're too tight. Loosen up.
How do you know so much about fitness without... well... having limbs?
Well, it's partially 'cuz it's programmed into me.
I'm also just real passionate about humans in general. Fitness is just the one aspect I really enjoy.
Interesting.
You're going too slow, now. You need to pick up the pace.
I'm... trying.
Don't overwork yourself.
Thanks, Rob. I will.
The rest of your shift is hard work!
You spend most of your time trying out the different machines. Though you try to keep fit, it's hard with a job like this.
It's nice to actually focus on a workout for once.
In between yelling at the screen, Rob talks about his day-to-day.
He talks about his ex-wife and two kids - you don't bother to ask how that's even possible.
At the end of the day, you're sweating and tired, but satisfied.
No doubt you'll be sore tomorrow, though.
Rob looks pleased with you.
Great job. Great workout. Hope you got something out of it.
Oh, I definitely did. Haha.
You tiredly finish your checklist and head out.
You don't work out?! Why the hell are you here then?
I figured I could just watch the game you're always looking at.
Nuh-uh. That won't do.
You are a DISGRACE to the nature of the game!
Get your head in it!
Uh... what?
Nevermind. Just sit down.
The rest of your shift is pretty entertaining, at least.
Rob refuses to acknowledge you, but his outbursts at the screen keep you awake.
The time goes by quickly enough, even though you feel judged the entire time.
16:00 comes around, and it's time to head out.
You finish your checklist and go back to the office.
Welcome back, Doctor! How did your shift go?
It went great. The shift was easy and went by quickly.
That's great to hear. I'll take the data you collected and you can head out for the night.
Like I said, it's a simple shift!
You hand your clipboard over Miss Esther. What an interesting day...
It was okay. Nothing happened, really.
Sometimes that's a good thing. Inaction is better than a bad reaction, after all.
I'll take your data for the day and you can head out for the night.
You hand your clipboard over to Miss Esther.
You enter back into your room.
You weren't out for very long - the clock reads 12:35.
You think back to Miss Esther's warning.
That was strangely out-of-character for her...
You shrug it off, for now.
You have to prepare your paperwork for tomorrow.
Before you know it, your eyes are getting heavy.
For a job with not a lot to do, there sure are a lot of emails to respond to...
You take a breath, mentally prepare yourself to start work again tomorrow, and lay down in your stasis chamber.
You wake up at 07:30. It's not so bad this time.
Seems your body is getting used to the new sleep schedule - something it'll regret when you go back to work in Manufacturing.
You sigh, change, grab your paperwork, and head out the door.
You arrive just before shift-start. Miss Esther is waiting for you.
Doctor! It's a brand-new day. A brand-new week, even.
Excited to get to work?
I guess you could say I am.
She seems unconcerned. Perhaps the warning she gave you yesterday was nothing to worry about, after all...
Excellent. Grab your paperwork - Kris is first, as usual.
You enter into the conference room. It seems everything is back to normal.
The screen is lit up once more, and Kris is back to watching it.
Miss Esther sighs. You can't tell if it's out of annoyance or relief.
Happy Monday, Kris.
Annoyance. It's probably annoyance.
Doctor. Good to see you. Welcome back.
Couldn't get enough of me, even after this weekend, hm?
Miss Esther looks at him suspiciously, but says nothing.
As you can most likely tell, things are back to normal for me.
Something I'm... very grateful for.
It seems that way, yes.
Miss Esther, you're... in high spirits today.
I suppose I am. Not entirely sure why, but...
...take what you can get, Kris.
Oh, do not worry. I will.

Yes... I did not appreciate the glitch last week that caused my panic.
I spoke to Finanical about it and they assured me that it shouldn't happen again, but...
I doubt their truthfulness.
Why's that?
They've lied to me in the past. Perhaps they see me as a shell of my former glory?
They forget who I used to be.
Regardless. I do not mean to be bitter, Doctor. Forgive me.
You help to... brighten my outlook, despite my pessimism.
Doctor, you should -
Ah, yes, Miss Esther. Finish my checklist and leave.
Why... yes. Exactly that.
Go on, Doctor. As always, it was a pleasure to have you.
I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.
Thank you, Kris.
You finish your checklist and leave the conference room.
As am I. I may not be... entirely content with what I do, but...
I feel quite... useless when I am not working.
Especially considering this is my sole purpose.
Ah, yeah. I understand.
I knew you would.
But, uh... yes. Everything is back to normal. Perfect, even. Now that you're here.
Kris... watch yourself.
Ah. Yes ma'am.
You're sweet, Kris. I should be going, though.
Mmm. No worries. Thank you for your concern.
Have an excellent day, Doctor.
Thank you.
You finish your checklist and leave the conference room.
Doctor. There you are. I was worried you'd be late again.
You'll be well aware when we're late, Kris.
And Miss Esther. Good morning to you.
I see your screen is back to being online.
Excellent powers of observation. Yes, Financial re-activated my screen.
I'm assuming everything's back to normal, then?
Yes. There are some aspects of my routine I enjoy...
He looks you up and down.
Others... not so much.
Now, Kris. Don't be rude.
Mmm. Forgive me.
I'm glad to see everything's alright in here, now.
Mhm.
I'll... uh, be going.
Yes. Thank you.
You finish your checklist and leave the conference room.
The short trip from the conference room to the break room is once again uneventful.
You enter into the breakroom to find a frightening sight.
Oh my - Heath, are you alright?!
Uh...
Kind of?
Heath is pinned to the wall of the stage by 4 different knives.
How did you even -
I-I'm honestly not sure, Doctor, I...
....I GOT YOU!
She suddenly whirls out of in-between the knives in an impressive feat of dexterity.
You thought I was actually stuck?
The GREAT AND AMAZING Heath would NEVER find herself in a predicament she couldn't escape from...
Lowly knives cannot contain me!
Not really magic, but...
So... what did you think, Doctor?
Yet another amazing trick by yours truly...
O-Or, not yours, uhh...

Hahaha! I'm so glad, Doctor.
And Miss Esther? You seemed so worried!
Yes. Worried I'd be stuck with even more paperwork tonight...
She's so harsh.
Everything's working fine in here, Heath?
Oh, yes. No complaints!
Although... when you stop by the gym today, could you ask Rob to turn his TV down?
It keeps breaking my concentration! I'm trying to plan my next show, and...
It sometimes surprises me how thin these walls are...
...although it is pretty much just management rails back there. And empty space.
So I guess it's not that surprising.
Yes, I'll make sure to tell him.
Great! Thank you, Doctor.
Now. You should be going.
Miss Esther's glaring at me. Haha!
You check the box off on your clipboard and leave the break room.
As am I! Haha.
Don't worry, Doctor. I'm well aware of what I can and can't do!
Plus, who would've thrown the knives at me, anyway?
You have a point.
I appreciate the concern, though.
I find I don't really take my... "safety" into consideration when I come up with my tricks.
Oh, that much is obvious, Heath.
But I got you both because of it!
Everything's working fine in here?
Oh, yes. No complaints!
Although... when you stop by the gym today, could you ask Rob to turn his TV down?
It keeps breaking my concentration! I'm trying to plan my next show, and...
It sometimes surprises me how thin these walls are...
...although it is pretty much just management rails back there. And empty space.
So I guess it's not that surprising.
Yes, I'll make sure to tell him.
Great! Thank you, Doctor.
Now. You should be going.
Miss Esther's glaring at me. Haha!
You check the box off on your clipboard and leave the break room.
Haha... ridiculous. Me, getting stuck!
I can't believe I finally got you, Miss Esther!
Don't oversell yourself, now.
Well then, Doctor. Come to check in on me as per usual?
Yes, that's right.
As you can see, everything's in ship-shape. Me, my equipment, my impeccable skill...
So there's no need for concern!
That's good.
You should be on your way now - you've got more cores to check in on, after all!
Ah, yes. You're right.
Thank you, Heath.
You check another box off your paperwork and leave the break room.
You begin heading upstairs towards the greenhouse.
Miss Esther follows close behind.
I couldn't help but notice that you don't seem to... get along with many other cores here.
Yes, I suppose you're right.
Honestly, I'm not sure why...
I like Aspen. They're a good kid - incredibly kind to everyone they meet.
And I feel for CC. His plight is an... indicator of how Aperture treats us.
But I'm not sure why I can't seem to... connect with any of the others.
It was the same while I was in Testing. The scientists would have favorite test subjects or coworkers or supervisors...
But for me, they were all the same.
I was there to do my job, not much else.
It's honestly only after starting this job that I began to truly... feel for others, in some aspects.
They used to call me the "Sociopath Core" while I worked in Testing... as a joke, of course.
But I - wait a minute...
Doctor! Miss Esther! Good to see you.
Gregory? What are you doing here?
I'm just on my way to the lounge - finished my work up top, so I'm headed down for a quick drink.
What do you do in your section, anyway?
Oh! Uhh...
Well, C7 is mostly for meetings and visits from shareholders...
I'm an event coordinator! Kind of. I make sure that the meeting rooms are set up and all the tech's working fine.
Then I leave before the important business people see me! Haha.

Aha, yes, it is, uh... thanks.
I didn't have many meetings to set up today, so I got to clock out early.
But hey! I got to run into you because of it, so, uh...
I'm glad.
Now, Miss Esther is starting to scare me with that glare of hers, so...
...I gotta run!
I'll see you later, Doctor!
And he's off.
They're certainly interesting, though the slightest bit annoying...
W-Well, yes, but it's not as easy as it sounds...
Every shareholder wants something different, and every manager likes a different setup...
Not only is it my job to get things ready, but it's also my job to remember everyone's preferences.
Thank goodness I have thrice the processing power of a -
Oh, I mean... uh...
Ahem. I work thrice as fast as -
Y'know what? Nevermind. I've gotta go!
And he's off.
They're certainly interesting, though the slightest bit annoying...
The two of you finally approach the greenhouse doors.
Go on now, Doctor. I'll be waiting for you.
You enter the greenhouse once more. Nothing seems out of the ordinary.
Aspen is turned away from you, watering in the back left corner.
Aspen?
They turn around.
Doctor! Come over here, please.
You walk over to the back corner and stand next to them.
Check it out - chrysanthemums!
Chrysanthemum × morifolium. Or, y'know, just... chrysanthemums. Florist's daisy.
Oh my.
They're testing micropropogation on them right now... thankfully, a pretty harmless procedure.
So they're doing really good at the moment.
They should have bloomed earlier, but things get weird underground.
I'm not sure how half of them still bloom at the right time of year anymore.
Regardless - aren't they beautiful?

O-Oh, I... um, uh...
Ahem. Uh...
Thank you, Doctor, I uh...
Don't know what to say to that.
You're... quite beautiful yourself.
Anyways! Um, everything's working fine in here right now.
Sprinkler isn't malfunctioning at all? Moss staying far away from your internal mechanisms?
Yep! All of that!
So you should, uh... get going. I think I need to...
...go dunk myself in the aqueduct.
You laugh and leave the greenhouse behind.
Anyways, that's what I wanted to show you. They just bloomed yesterday!
Everything else is working fine. Nothing to report, no concerns.
It seems most of the specimens have recovered from that brief power loss a few days ago, so that's good!
Glad to hear.
Anyways, you should probably be on your way, Doctor. Miss Esther is waiting for you.
Ah, yes. I'll be going now.
See you tomorrow!
You say your goodbyes to Aspen and leave the greenhouse behind.
Oh, Doctor. Welcome back.
Here for my check-in, right?
Yes, that's correct.
Well, everything's proceeding as normal. I don't have any complaints.
We are in a delicate testing cycle right now though, so... if you could limit your time here, that would be great.
I just need to make sure you're not malfunctioning in any way.
When I started, I was told your sprinkler can cause issues, so...
I did already say I didn't have any complaints, Doctor.
If there was something wrong with my sprinkler I would have said it then.
Ah. Yes.
Uh... thank you, Aspen. I'll be going now.
Thank you, Doctor. I'll see you tomorrow.
You shake your head and leave the greenhouse behind.
Miss Esther is waiting for you outside.
Hello again, Doctor. Hope everything went well in there!
Let's be on our way back down to CC, now.
I swear...
Sometimes it feels like the trip from the main section to this upper part takes up half our shift...
You don't run into anyone on your way to CC's room.
Miss Esther seems very happy about that.
Here we are now. No noises inside the room today...
Let's go in.
You enter into CC's room. He's staring out the window beside him.
You don't know what he's looking at, considering all you can see outside it is a blank white void.
Good afternoon, CC. How has your day been?
Good, all things considered.
The usual.
If you were worried I was getting better, Miss Esther...
No need to anymore. I feel worse than ever.
Oh, CC...
Oh, and Doctor. Good to see you again.
I hope you do not find my pesimissm off-putting.
As you're well aware, it's difficult to be positive sometimes.
I know. I understand.
Seeing your face always brightens my day, though.
Is there anything you need? Anything I can help with?
Not that I can think of, no. I always appreciate your concern, though.
You make me feel like I'm not just an experiment anymore.

I... oh.
Doctor, you're... too kind to me, haha.
Thank you.
You... should be going, now. More check-ins to do, yes?
Thank you, CC.
Doctor... please come and see me tomorrow.
I will.
You check CC off your list and leave the room with Miss Esther.
Haha. Thank you, Doctor.
Even if you're only here for one more week, I will remember your kindness.
You should go, now. I think I need rest.
Yes. Of course. Have a good day, CC.
Thank you.
You check CC off your list and leave the room with Miss Esther.
Oh... Doctor. My apologies, I didn't see you there.
I'm assuming you two have come for my check-up.
Yes, that's correct.
Well, as I just mentioned, I'm still sick. Very much so.
No matter how much I rest, it doesn't get any better...
Of course, I know it won't, but...
I'm sorry, CC.
It's alright, Miss Esther. But you two should be going. I'm sure you have more to attend to.
Yes. Thank you, CC.
You check CC off your list and leave the room with Miss Esther.
Miss Esther is quiet on the way to the gym.
Her mood seems to flip on a dime - incredibly happy and energetic at one point, solemn and quiet the next.
It makes her hard to read.
You approach the gym door without any interruptions.
Doc! Essie! How's it hanging?
Good to see you both alive.
Why wouldn't we be alive?
Ah, you never know what could happen, yeah?
Can't ever be too careful!
Nice to see you again, Rob. Everything's alright in here?
Yep! All good, as per -
ARE YOU KIDDING ME? WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?! DUMBASS!!
...as per usual, yeah.
I really wish you'd stop yelling so much, Rob.
Agh, sorry, Essie.
And stop calling me Essie. That's Miss Esther to you.
Habits! What can ya do, yeah?
Anyway, Doc, it's all good.
Oh - Heath asked me to tell you to turn your TV down.
She can hear it from all the way over there?
Yikes. She must hate me, haha.
Ah, I gotcha. I'll turn it down. My bad.

'Course, Doc.
Now you should prolly -
GO! GO!! COME ON! WHAT THE HELL, JACOB?
- get goin'. S'almost four, yeah?
Ah yeah, you're right. Thanks again, Rob.
Yeah, s'no problem. See ya tomorrow!
You finish off your checklist and head back towards the office.
Ah, uh, thank you, Doc. Kind of you to say that.
Even though I ain't really a man at all, but...
I'm pickin' up what you're puttin' down.
Eugh.
Now you should prolly -
GO! GO!! COME ON! WHAT THE HELL, JACOB?
- get goin'. S'almost four, yeah?
Ah yeah, you're right. Thanks again, Rob.
Anytime, Doc. Always willing to do ya some good.
If there's anything else I can do for you...
...you just let me know.
Will do.
See ya tomorrow!
You finish off your checklist and head back towards the office.
Essie! And you brought the Doc with you.
Just here for the regular routine checkup.
Ah, yeah. Why else would you be here?
Not like you care 'bout ol' Rob, anyhow.
Now, Rob, let's be professional, here.
Kinda hard when I'm not treated with respect, Essie.
To be entirely fair, you don't show me much respect, either.
Got me there.
Anyway. Everything's runnin' fine, so you don't gotta put any little notes on your clipboard there.
Oh - Heath did ask me to tell you to turn your TV down.
She can hear it from all the way over there?
Yikes. She must hate me, haha. That makes two of ya, I suppose.
I'll turn it down. She's got nothing to worry about.
Thank you.
Alrigh', now, you should get goin'. I don't wanna miss any of my game for this.
We'll be leaving.
And with that, you finish off your checklist and head back to your office.
Well! Uneventful day, all things considered.
That's the way I like it! Haha.
Now - expect the normal routine. You should check your email before heading to bed.
Thank you for your work today, Doctor. I will see you tomorrow.
You enter your chambers once more.
Well... Kris certainly gave me a run for my money today... haha!
I wonder where Heath got that dove from... haha.
You place the cactus Aspen gave you, [cactusname], beside your "bed".
The flowers look as bright as ever.
I never expected CC to recite poetry to me...
You place your Topps baseball card by your "bed".
It's honestly a little shocking he would give this to me... haha.
A fairly... normal day, all things considered.
Throwing your paperwork down for the day, you sigh.
You lay down in your stasis chamber for the night.
You wake up at 7:30, more ready for the day than ever.
Only two more days...
You grab your paperwork, get dressed, and leave your chambers.
You enter your office.
Miss Esther isn't here yet.
Strange...
The last time she was late was my second day here.
You sit down at your desk and organize while you wait.
Eventually, it's 08:30, and she still hasn't shown.
Where is she?
You decide to wait a little longer.
The clock now reads 09:00. No sign of your supervisor.
Uh...
I suppose I should just... get to work?
You gather your materials, compose yourself, and head towards Kris.
You enter Kris' room without Miss Esther behind you. It still feels a little strange.
Doctor? You're late.
Where's Miss Esther?
No clue. That's why I'm behind - she never showed up today.
Strange... that woman is exceedingly punctual.
It's not like her to be late...
Anyhow. Things are proceeding as normal here.
And you look amazing today, Doctor. As usual.
Thank you. You don't look too bad yourself.
Don't flatter me too much, now, or people might start to think...
He sighs.
As much as I'd love for you to stay and... waste time with me...
...you're very far behind on schedule.
Yes, I know.
Miss Esther may not be here to usher you along, but you must stay disciplined.
You do have paperwork to turn in still, after all.
You're right.
Plus... I'm sure we'll have plenty of time this weekend.
Go on now! Have a wonderful day, Doctor.
You too, Kris.
I always have a good day after seeing you.
You finish checking Kris off your list and leave the room.
You only have two more days left until you go back to Manufacturing.
Are you looking forward to it?
I'm not sure.
Fair enough.
Change is difficult.
I'm curious who the permanent employee for this position might be...
If they're anything like you, I'll be happy. All I ask is for is someone kind.
Now. As much as I'd love to have you stay and chat, you're very far behind on schedule.
Yes, I know.
Miss Esther may not be here to usher you along, but you must stay disciplined.
You do have paperwork to turn in still, after all.
You're right.
Go on now! Have a wonderful day, Doctor.
You too, Kris.
I will.
You finish checking Kris off your list and leave the room.
Not like you care all that much. Simply here to do a job, after all.
Not to be hostile or anything, but you do distract my focus when you're here, Doctor.
Sorry.
Don't be sorry. Can't control it. What can you do?
You only have two more days left until you go back to Manufacturing.
I'm curious who the permanent employee for this position might be...
If they're anything like you, I'll be incredibly disappointed.
Now. I'd love for you to stay and chat, but you are behind schedule. You should be on your way.
Yes. Thank you, Kris.
You finish checking Kris off your list and leave the room.
You enter Heath's break room once again.
Welcome, Doctor! Prepare for an interesting trick...
...wait, where's Miss Esther?
I'm not sure. She never showed up.
Weird...
There's a metal bucket hanging from her handle.
What's the bucket for?
Patience, patience! All shall be revealed.
First though - look inside the bucket. It's empty, correct?
You do so. There's nothing in there.
Yes, it's empty.
As soon as you step back, you hear a metal clank sound, and the bucket shifts slightly.
Are you so sure?
You look inside the bucket - there's an Aperture credit in there.
What... how did you do that?
Magic!
...and...
You hear another clank, though gentler, and she shows you the bucket again.
The credit is gone.
...a little bit of showmanship! Haha!
She tosses the bucket to the side with flair.
Now... for the final part of the trick...
Check your left pocket!
You check. There's a credit in it.
Oh my god.
Keep it, Doc! A little gift from me.
There's plenty more where that came from!
She looks at you happily.
That was incredible, Heath. Just like you.
Why thank you, Doctor. You aren't too bad yourself! Haha.
S-Sorry. I'm still a little nervous after yesterday!
And Miss Esther's not here to balance the mood out.
You're alright. It's cute.
I know I am!
I wish you could stay, Doctor, I really do. I love your company, but...
From the look of the clock, you're really behind schedule! And my trick today took up a lot of time, haha.
Oh - yes, I should probably get going.
Don't worry - I'll see you this weekend, right?
I hope so.
Wonderful. Have an excellent day, Doctor!
I always do after seeing you.
You check Heath off your list and leave the break room.
What'd you think of that trick, Doc?
Impressive. I don't know how you did it.
Difficult without hands, but I make it work!
Imagine if I did have hands! I'd be the best magician ever!
I do find it interesting that Miss Esther didn't show...
She's usually very tough on herself.
Yeah, I'm not sure. I just decided I should probably get my job done.
Speaking of! Looking at the clock, you're far behind schedule - you should probably go!
Sorry for taking up so much time!
You're alright, Heath, no worries.
Have a great day, Doctor. I'll see you tomorrow?
Yes.
You check Heath off your list and leave the break room.
Who knows? Maybe it'll help you be a little more positive!
What does that mean?
Oh, nothing, haha.
I do find it interesting that Miss Esther didn't show...
She's usually very tough on herself.
Yeah...
Anyways! My trick took a lot of time today, and you're behind.
You should get going!
Oh. Yes. I will.
Thank you, Heath.
You check Heath off your list and leave the break room.
You enter your chambers for what feels like the 8th time.
...probably because this is the 8th time.
Only 4 more days till you're out of here...

You lay down in your stasis chamber for the night and close your eyes.
You wake up at 07:30, ready for the day.
Well, as ready as you can be.
You get dressed and head out the door.
Hello... Doctor.
Miss Esther? Are you okay?
Yes, just... incredibly tired.
How can a core be tired?
I'm not even sure. I just know I'm exhausted for some reason.
Anyways, let's get started on our shift, Doctor.
Yes ma'am.
It takes you no time at all to get to the conference room.
Kris, it's time... for your check-in.
Er, Miss Esther... is everything alright?
She's tired, apparently.
Very much so.
Well. I have good news for you, then - everything's running smoothly here.
I don't have anything to report today.
The stock is looking better than ever, and I'm running smoothly as well.
Do you want to see how smoothly I'm running, Doctor?
I-I'm okay. Thank you. Haha.
Your loss.
Anyways...
That's great to hear, Kris. I'm glad things are going well.
As am I.
Doctor, I know you have your one-on-one supervising shift tomorrow, and...
...well, I know I can't ask you to choose me, but...
It would be well in your interest to supervise me tomorrow.
That's all I'll say.
Kris... what are you saying?
Nothing, Miss Esther. I apologise.
Always good to see your face, Doctor.
Sunshine on a cloudy day.
...whatever that means.

Well. You should be going. I know you have plenty to do today.
I hope I see you here tomorrow.
Goodbye, Kris. I'll see you later.
You check Kris off your list and leave the conference room.
Ah. Ahem. Thank you, Doctor.
It's most likely because I polished my chassis last night, but...
Um. You should be going. I know you have plenty to do today.
I... hope I see you tomorrow.
Goodbye, Kris. I'll see you later.
You check Kris off your list and leave the conference room.
I'm glad things are going well. That's good to hear.
Thank god, right? Now you don't have to check off a different box than usual.
Such an exhausting task.
Now, Kris, just because I'm tired -
I apologize, Miss Esther.
Haha... truly, I do not know what's gotten into me lately.
Forgive me.
Uh... well, if everything's okay in here, we should probably be going.
Mmm. That's an excellent idea, Doctor.
Have a good day.
You too.
You hesitantly check Kris off your list and leave the conference room.
I apologize for not being my... usual self, Doctor.
I hope this shift goes by quickly.
Doc! And...
...Miss Esther, yeah?
Shocker bumpin' into you two here.
Shocker?! You're in the way of our route.
Not that much of a surprise that we're doing our job on a Tuesday morning, is it?

Oh, uh... you too, Doc.
Sorry you ain't seen me yesterday, I uh... I was busy.
Glad I bumped into ya now, though.
Ugh. Doctor, can we move on? Please.
Ah, yeah, sorry, should prolly get out of your way, but...
Hey Doc, if you see me later, I got something important to tell ya, alright?
L-Later though, not now, hah.
Alright. I'll keep that in mind.
Catch ya later. Hopefully.
Ah, yeah, sorry, should prolly get out of your way.
I'll catch ya later, Doc.
Agh, sorry, yeah, I'm movin'.
Jeez, you're real rude.
See ya, Doc.
Ah, thank god. That core annoys me to such an incredible extent, I...
Oh, we're here.
I forget how close Kris and Heath are to each other...
Doctor! I've got another trick for you today!
...and I'm not putting myself in danger this time!
She turns around briefly, then turns back with four metal rings hanging from her handles.
Now... pay close attention.
You see here - all four rings are connected, yes?
Yes.
Are you so sure about that?
With an upwards flick of her handle, the rings seem to disconnect from one another mid-air -
And by the time they land back down, they're split into two and two.
TADA!!
Just a little... sleight-of-handle.
Wow! That's incredible, Heath.
Yes, yes, I know, I know, haha.
You're always my best audience, Doctor.
Now, I know you have places to be - but hear me out for one second!
You have your one-on-one shift tomorrow, yeah?
If you choose me, I have a very special show to put on for you!
No pressure of course, but...
Heath... watch yourself.
Aha, yes, Miss Esther. Anyways, Doc, I hope you'll stop by to see it!
You definitely pay more attention than the last guy did! Hahaha.

Doctor...
Oh - ahem. Well...
That must make me the best magician EVER!
Or you meant it, as in like, I'm annoying...
...but I don't think you did.
Glad I can bring a smile to your face, Doctor!
Doctor, we should continue our route, now.
Ah, yes. You should leave!
I'm sure I'll see you tomorrow!
Thank you, Heath.
You check Heath off and leave the break room with Miss Esther.
Ah, true. He really didn't care much for me, haha.
Which is why I'm glad you're here! If only temporarily.
Now - Miss Esther's giving me that look, Doc... y'know, the "shut up before I yell at you" look?
So you should probably be going.
Great power of observation, Heath.
Yes, we'll be going now. Thank you, Heath.
You check Heath off and leave the break room with Miss Esther.
I genuinely don't know how you did that.
I know you feel this is a waste of time, Doctor, but this is my passion.
Forgive me if I can't resist the urge to show off!
As you can see, though, everything here is working jsut fine.
I know you have a schedule to keep, so...
...Yes, I'll be going.
Wonderful! I mean...
Have a great day, Doctor!
You check Heath off and leave the break room with Miss Esther.
You know, running along these management rails all day takes a lot more out of me than you might think...
I still can't understand how you get tired.
As I've said, I'm not sure either. Perhaps it's something Aperture programmed into us, to make us more...
..."human".
Frankly, I don't see the appeal of being human...
Other than the legs, of course.

See! There's the spirit.
Ugh. I can't put in that much energy right now.
That's good, I suppose.
Sorry if I seem a little... off today, Doctor.
I really can't put in that much energy today.
Before you know it, you've reached the greenhouse upstairs.
I'll just be out here... resting my optic.
You enter the greenhouse.
Everything seems to be normal from the outside.
You're well aware by now, of course, that the only person that could tell something is off would be -
Aspen? I'm here for your check-in.
Aspen turns around to face you.
They greet you with a smile. Or something like it.
Doctor! Ah, it's great to see you. How are you?
I'm doing good, Aspen. How are you?
Great! Everything's going smooth. The chrysanthemums I showed you yesterday are blooming even bigger than before.
You know, chrysanthemums are used in tea sometimes, and it's generally believed it has several health benefits...
In addition, they can reduce air pollution in some cases! In small amounts, of course, but...
Oh shoot, I'm rambling again, aren't I?
S-Sorry, Doctor, sorry.

Aha... that's twice in a row now, you've said... something...
...like that.
Doctor, I...
Well, um, uh...
...thank you.
Look, I know I'm not really supposed to ask you this...
And I'm stepping way over my programming here, but...
...If you could, do you think you could supervise me during your one-on-one tomorrow?
I have something... important to tell you.
I'll think about it, Aspen.
Ah, good. I know it's... strange of me to ask, haha...
I-I really don't know what to say to that, haha.
But yes! Everything's working fine. We're all - I mean, I'm... uh.
Well.
As much as I hate to say it, I should probably be going now.
Miss Esther is most likely waiting for me.
Oh! Um. Yes.
Have a good day, Doctor!
I hope you'll choose me tomorrow.
You check Aspen off your list and leave the greenhouse.
Thank you, thank you, Doctor.
I knew you'd understand.
But yes, uh... you have nothing to worry about.
That's good.
I should probably be on my way, then - Miss Esther's waiting for me.
Of course Doctor! I'll see you on Thursday for sure!
You check Aspen off your list and leave the greenhouse.
They greet you with... actually, you're not quite sure what that look is.
Oh, Doctor! Hello again.
Hi, Aspen. Is everything going well in here?
Yes, as usual, everything is fine.
I'm glad to be working in here. The plants keep me company. And they're very kind.
Especially when most people aren't.
Anyways!
You've got nothing to worry about, Doctor! Haha. So you can go.
Uh... alright.
Have a good day!
You hesitantly check Aspen off your list and leave the greenhouse.
Ah. Doctor. Welcome back.
Let's be on our way to CC, now.
You follow Miss Esther as she tiredly leads you on her rail.

She laughs softly.
I'm doing wonderful, Doctor! Simply excellent.
...no, Doctor, I'm not okay. As I said, I'm very tired.
Please... a little silence would be nice.
Ah. Yes. I'm sorry.
Eventually, you two approach the door to CC's room.
You hear... "coughing" from inside. It seems CC is already awake.
You open the door.
Doctor... Miss Esther.
He sounds much... rougher than usual.
Forgive me for my brevity. I am...
He coughs harshly.
...not feeling my best.
CC... you sound terrible.
Haha... yes, I'm aware.

Mmm. Thank you, Doctor.
I know. I appreciate that.
Honestly, how I feel is up and down on the best of days...
I just hope it isn't worse tomorrow.
As do I.
Everything's as it should be, though, Doctor.
You know... seeing you is one of the only things keeping me going right now.
...
Forgive me. That came... out of nowhere.
I am sorry, Doctor.
Don't be, CC. It's alright.
Doctor, we should be leaving - CC needs his rest.
Ah. Yes. Very true.
Please rest, CC.
I will.
Wait - Doctor. Before you leave.
I know it seems quite... boring in here, but...
...if you could choose me for your supervising shift tomorrow, that would be wonderful.
I know it's not my place to ask, but...
We'll see.
Thank you.
You check CC off your list and quietly close the door behind you.
Ah, it's alright.
Nothing I haven't been through before.
Still.
Everything's as it should be in here, though.
I'm worse than usual - that's the only change.
Should be good for your paperwork though, yes?
I guess.
Thank you for your consideration, Doctor.
You should be on your way, though - I know you have a schedule to keep.
Ah. Yes.
Thank you, CC.
You check him off your list and gently close the door behind you.
Miss Esther... Doctor.
He sounds much... rougher than usual.
I am...
He coughs harshly.
...not feeling my best.
Apologies.
CC... are you okay?
Haha... no, but it's alright.
Honestly... I just need some rest at the moment.
I understand, CC. Don't worry, we'll be brief.
I think we have all the information we need, anyways.
We'll be going.
Thank you, Miss Esther.
Have a good day.
You check CC off your list and leave the room.
Oh thank god. Our route's almost done.
I am so ready to crash into my... charging... port.
...I guess that phrase doesn't really make sense if I don't have a bed, huh?
Anyways. Let's be on our way. Quickly now.
Miss Esther advances rapidly on her rail while you try to keep up.
You make it to the gym in no time.
I do hope I won't have a reason to yell at him today...
Go go go go GO GO GO GO GO!! COME ON...
You wait patiently.
GOAL!! YEAH, HAHAHA!
Oh, Doc. Didn't see you there.
Sorry, sorry, haha.
Good to see ya, Doc. How's your shift been so far?
Not bad. Miss Esther's very tired today, so we've kind of been rushing through it.
Essie? Tired?
Was bound to happen eventually.
He turns to Miss Esther.
You work yourself too hard.
Yes, yes... I'm aware.
Anyways, Doc. Real good you're here.
You're the highlight of my day. Other than the game, 'course.
That's sweet. Everything working out alright in here?
Yeah. All the machines are up n' running. I even had someone come in earlier today, which is always a pleasant surprise.
I'm glad to hear that. Keeps you busy.
...and awake.
...Now, I'm not really s'posed to say this, but... before you go...
You should totally come by during your one-on-one tomorrow.
I got a surprise for ya if you do.
Watch yourself, Robert.
DON'T CALL ME THAT!
Anyway. Yeah.
Doctor, are you ready to leave now? I am exhausted.
Oh, yes, Miss Esther. Let's go.

Will do.
You check Rob off your list once more and head back to your office.
Would prefer if I didn't see ya at all, haha.
Wow. Rude.
Anyway. Everything's working fine. Things are normal, you've got nuthin' to worry about here.
GO! GO! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU - oh my GOD...
Now I... I'm sure you have work to do -
Oh no, it's the end of your shift, huh...
Well, an employee is bound to come in here any time now, so... haha...
Y'all should prolly get going.
Alright then.
You check Rob off your list once more and head back to your office.
Alright! Great job, blah blah blah, check your emails...
I'm going to bed. Or... you know what I mean.
I'll see you tomorrow, Doctor.
Rest well, Miss Esther.
You enter your room once more.

You lay down in your stasis chamber.
Tomorrow's a big day.
You wake up at 07:30, groggy and tired. Not a good start to what's probably going to be a long shift.
Almost done with this week...
You get up, grab your paperwork, and leave for your office.
Doctor! Good morning. How are you?
I'm alright. You seem to be feeling better.
Yes, much better, haha. Not as tired, for sure!
Alright - you know the drill. Today's the one-on-one observation day.
Unfortunately, every single one of the cores under our section has specifically requested -
- either to me, or to HR -
- that you don't oversee them today.
I don't know what you did to cause that, but...
I'm going to put you with CC today. Since he doesn't have a job to maintain, the shift should go by quickly.
Just try not to be too bothersome to him, alright?
Have a good shift, Doctor.
Who are you interested in overseeing?

Unfortunately, Kris has requested you not supervise him today.
You'll have to choose again.
Heath has specifically requested you not supervise her alone.
You'll have to choose again.
I'm afraid Aspen contacted HR and asked that you not oversee him today.
You'll have to choose again.
CC asked me personally not to see you today, Doctor. I'm sorry.
You'll have to choose again.
Rob asked me not to let you in the gym today, for some reason.
You'll have to choose again.
I don't know how you can stand to be around that man...
None of my concern, though!
I'm sure you remember your way to the conference room - it's just right around the corner, after all.
Have a good shift, Doctor.
Thank you, Miss Esther.
You enter the conference room. Kris turns to you.
Doctor... hello.
Uh... hello, Kris.
I'm glad you chose to supervise me today. I was... nervous. You wouldn't.
Ha. You. Nervous.
I can be.
I was still surprised when Miss Esther sent me the message.
But... glad.
Is that so?
Why yes. I do enjoy your company, you know.
I wouldn't be... treating you like I have recently, if I didn't.
Apologies, Doctor. I'm a little anxious today.
You're okay, Kris.
Listen... I have something to ask you, Doctor.
And it's not what you think it is.
It isn't?
Well, I'm actually not quite sure, but...
...you might...
He sighs.
Whatever.
The scene fades to Kris looking down, offering you a silver watch in a blue box.
This... is for you. It's a watch.
Obviously.
A few years ago, when I was still a consultant, I won employee of the month in my department.
The prize for it was a watch.
I told them, "I don't have wrists - what am I supposed to do with this?"
Well. Now I know.
I've... really been enjoying your company lately, Doctor, and I...
Don't want it to end. Anytime soon.
Your time in maintenance may be coming to an end, but...
I hope our relationship won't.

Oh, Doctor...
I'm so glad.
Well then. Ahem.
Doctor, now that we're... closer...
I suppose you might want to know some things about me.
I'm ashamed to admit it, but I do stretch the truth sometimes in terms of my monetary success...
I am just a core, after all.
I do own stock, and I am quite financially successful, but most of that interest goes right back into Aperture's pocket...
So as of right now, I don't have any funds of my own, really.
That's alright.
I don't want to be dishonest with you, Doctor.
So... what about you?
Well, there's not much to say about me, really.
I'm kind of a homebody... I stay inside a lot.
I got my degree in engineering about a year ago, and got hired here shortly after.
That explains your original position in Manufacturing, then.
Yes. I've always liked engineering.
Well, I'm glad you gave Maintenance a fair shot, then.
The rest of your shift is a little awkward, but nice.
Kris seems incredibly happy...
Though he would never let that slip.
You ask him about the watch he gave you.
I'm not sure of the brand - frankly, I believe Aperture may have made the model, cheap and in-house.
Cave would do anything to save even a penny in the years before his death...
So it makes sense employee rewards were cut back, as well.
I'm surprised I even recieved anything in the first place, haha.
And now it's in your hands.
I'll treat it well, Kris.
Hopefully as well as you treat me, aha...
Eventually, the time comes for you to leave.
It's almost time for my shift end, Kris. I should be going.
I'm sure Miss Esther is waiting.
Yes, I...

You lean over to him and gently kiss him on the chassis.
Doctor!
W-Well then. Yes, you should be going, I...
Ahem. Have a good night.
You too, Kris.
You finish your checklist quickly and leave the conference room, and Kris, behind.
Goodbye, Kris. I'll see you tomorrow.
Yes. I'll see you tomorrow, Doctor.
You finish your checklist quickly and leave the conference room, and Kris, behind.
Well then. Ahem. I'm... sorry for assuming things, Doctor.
You can keep the watch. I obviously have no use for it, haha.
I hope this won't sour your opinion of me.
No, it's alright, Kris. I understand.
I'm just...
You don't have to explain yourself.
I am aware what I just asked was... a difficult question.
The rest of your shift is a little awkward, but it goes by quickly.
Kris seems a little uneasy and nervous...
Though he would never let that slip.
You ask him about the watch he gave you.
I'm not sure of the brand - frankly, I believe Aperture may have made the model, cheap and in-house.
Cave would do anything to save even a penny in the years before his death...
So it makes sense employee rewards were cut back, as well.
I'm surprised I even recieved anything in the first place, haha.
Eventually, the time comes for you to leave.
It's almost time for my shift end, Kris. I should be going.
I'm sure Miss Esther is waiting.
Ah, yes. Thank you for your time, Doctor.
And... I apologize. For earlier.
It's okay, Kris.
You finish your checklist quickly and leave the conference room, and Kris, behind.
Alright! Should be a fun shift, then, at least.
I'm sure you remember the way to the break room. Have a good shift, Doctor.
Thank you, Miss Esther.
You enter the break room to find all the lights turned off - except for one.
The stage is lit up by a spotlight, something you're certain wasn't there before.
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen...
Or... well, I guess it's just you, Doctor...
...to Heath, the Magic Core's, grandest show yet!
The curtains part slightly and Heath comes rolling out on her management rail.
Doctor! Welcome, welcome! Do I have a surprise for you today...
She turns down for just a second, seemingly fiddling with something inside her chassis.
Behold... my magnum opus!
With a sudden explosion of sparkle and feathers, a dove emerges from Heath's chassis.
In its beak, it's holding a perfectly-preserved letter.
TADA! For you, Doctor - a special letter!
You see, this past week and a half has been possibly the most exciting of my life so far...
A captive audience! A caring one, at that!
Someone who doesn't find my... energy off-putting.
And so - with this letter - I ask you one simple question, Doctor...
Ahem.
I've enjoyed my time with you... performing, talking, showing off, of course...
...and I know, soon, you'll have to leave to go back to maintenance.
My question is... um...
...will you please keep coming by to see me, Doctor?
I have so many shows I can put on for you, so many things I want to tell you... I...
I really, really like you, Doctor. Do you... get what I'm saying?

Oh, Doctor...
Thank you, thank you!
I'm so, so glad you do, Doctor.
Aha... I was worried... I was overstepping my place.
Didn't think you'd take a chance on a core - let alone one as energetic as myself!
What can I say? You're entertaining.
Oh trust me... you haven't seen the half of it.
Though, Doctor... there is something you should know about me... that might affect... this.
What's up?
Well - you know how I'm SO GOOD at magic, right?
Actually performing magic takes a lot of quick-thinking skills, quick movements...
Stuff a lot of cores can't do with their natural programming.
When I was being manufactured, the engineers... overclocked my systems.
I'm running about two times as fast as I should be!
Helps with the magic, but...
Here, touch me.
Uh... okay.
You reach out your hand and touch Heath's chassis. It's incredibly warm.
What the... you're burning up, Heath.
Haha, yeah, they forgot to account for that... I'm not cooled properly.
It really isn't an issue - the pain doesn't really bother me at all - but I figured I should let you know.
The pain?
Oh, and don't worry about the letter, haha. They were just props! Nothing in the letter.
The dove, though... don't know where she went...
The rest of your shift is exciting. Heath's natural charm makes the initial awkwardness fade away fast.
She seems incredibly happy. Moreso than usual, even.
You know - even if you and I are - uh, a thing now...
You still don't get to know the secrets behind my tricks!
Eventually, the time comes for your shift to end.
Miss Esther is waiting for me, Heath. I should be going.
Oh, yes. You should. I wouldn't want to keep you too long, haha!
Doctor, I...

You lean over and gently kiss Heath on the chassis. It's very warm, but it doesn't hurt too much.
Oh! Doctor, I - well! Didn't see that one coming!
Looks like I'm not the only one full of surprises, haha.
Have a good day, Doctor!
You too, Heath. I'll see you tomorrow.
You finish your checklist and head back to the office.
Goodnight, Heath.
Oh yes! Goodnight, Doctor. I'll see you tomorrow.
Yes. You will.
You finish your checklist and head back to the office.
Oh, no worries, Doctor. I'm sorry!
I must've read things wrong. That's on me.
It's alright, Heath, I just -
No! No need to explain! You're alright, I understand!
Oh, and don't worry about the letter, haha. They were just props! Nothing in the letter.
The dove, though... don't know where she went...
The rest of your shift is pretty normal, all things considered.
Heath's stage presence makes the initial awkwardness fade away fast.
You know - even if I just, like... revealed my heart to you...
You still don't get to know the secrets behind my tricks!
Eventually, the time comes for your shift to end.
Miss Esther is waiting for me, Heath. I should be going.
Oh, yes. You should! Sorry to keep you, Doctor.
Have a good day, Heath. I'll see you tomorrow.
Yes you will!
You finish your checklist and head back to the office.
Oh, good. I was hoping you'd choose them.
You remember the way - upstairs and on your left.
Yes. Thank you, Miss Esther.
Have a good shift!
You enter the greenhouse and are immediately greeted by Aspen.
Doctor! Hello, I, uh...
Wasn't expecting you today.
And I wasn't... entirely prepared... for you, either.
Hahaha! Ignore me, I'm alright.
How are you, Aspen?
I'm good. Great, even. You're here. And I...
Well, uh...
They sigh.
I've got to get this over with someday, haha... and I'm running out of time to.
What are you talking about?
Umm...
This cactus... it's for you.
I know you're probably tired of my botany facts, but...
This is a Scarlet Ball Cactus - parodia haselbergii.
S-She's easy to care for, as most cacti are...
...but she reminds me of... you and I.
I'm the prickly, hard-to-reach, defensive thorns, but...
You're these beautiful flowers o-on top, bringing light to my darkness.
I'm really sorry if this is me being too... forward, but, Doctor...
I-I really like you. A lot. You've brought more to my life than anyone has... than anything has, and I -
I hope you accept this token of affection from me, and I...
When you leave, I truly hope you don't forget me.

You... oh, Doctor, I...
Goodness. You're something, alright.
This cactus is beautiful, Aspen. Thank you.
You're welcome, Doctor.
What are you going to name her?

That's a great name!
Anyways, Doctor, I-I'm glad you've been... accepting of me, and - my awkward confession here.
It wasn't awkward. It was cute.
I - uh... please stop complimenting me, I don't know how to handle it, haha...
I'm so happy you don't think I'm weird.
Being alone in this greenhouse all day, it... doesn't help my anxiety.
So I'm glad I have you... and I'm so, so lucky.
The rest of your shift is peaceful. As usual, Aspen talks the majority of the time, rattling off facts about all kinds of plants.
Heliotropium arborescens has been my most recent study - the garden heliotrope.
It has these beautiful purple flowers that smell like vanilla... or so I'm told. I can't really smell them myself.
And it's poisonous! That's one thing I love about the plant world...
The most beautiful flowers can also be the most deadly!
Isn't that interesting?
Yes, it is.
Sorry, sorry, I'm rambling again, aren't I?
Don't stop. I like it.
Oh...
Before you know it, the shift has rushed by, and it's almost 14:00.
Aspen - it's time for me to go. I don't want to, but...
Oh no, I understand.
And, Doctor, I...

You lean over and gently kiss Aspen's chassis, avoiding the moss-covered areas.
O-Oh... Oh my goodness. I... well. Doctor.
That was...
Well.
I'll see you tomorrow, Aspen.
I, uh, yes! I'll see you tomorrow.
Have a great night. I'll see you tomorrow.
See you tomorrow, Aspen.
You finish your checklist and leave the greenhouse.
O-Oh. I'm sorry for assuming, Doctor, I...
That's on me.
I hope we can stay... friends.
Of course we can, you're alright.
I'm so happy you don't think I'm weird.
Being alone in this greenhouse all day, it... doesn't help my anxiety.
So I'm glad you're understanding.

Oh no, I understand.
Have a good day, Doctor. Thanks for choosing me today.
I'll see you tomorrow.
You finish your checklist and leave the greenhouse.
Oh, good. I was hoping you'd pick him.
I know he's been getting sicker...
I'm sure he'd love the company.
I'm sure you remember your way to the residential district.
Have a great shift!
Thank you, Miss Esther.
It takes no time at all to reach CC's room.
When you enter, you find him staring at the photo you gave him.
When you enter, you find him staring out his window once again.
Hello, CC.
He stays turned away from you.
Hello, Doctor.
Are you alright?
Yes. I am. I just...
He turns to face you.
I have something very important to tell you.
Oh. Alright.
I'm going to phrase it in a particular way, however, as I'm...
...not sure I have the words otherwise.
I wore apathy like armor...
...but cracked every time you looked at me, like I was worth being seen.
Even now I blame timing.
As if clocks are crueler than my own hesitation.
As if... love didn't stand right in front of me -
- and wait with open hands -
- as mine stayed tucked in pockets.
I...
Doctor, you have been so kind to me over the past week and a half, and I...
I've never felt anything like this before.
I feel... energized. Like I'm truly living, like... there's a light at the end of my tunnel.
Please, Doctor. When your time in maintenance ends, I hope our time together won't.
Please stay by me.

Oh. I...
You...
He sighs.
Thank you, Doctor.
...I don't think I can accept this, CC. I'm sorry.
I honestly didn't expect you to... say yes.
Not only am I a robot, not only am I stuck in this godforsaken room...
But I'm so horribly sick.
I hope you aren't simply taking pity on me, Doctor.
Not at all, CC. I do truly enjoy your company.
Thank you.
Your shift continues on slowly. You and CC chat gently, pausing occasionally to let him rest.
Life is an... interesting concept to me.
It's not as easily definable as a lot of the scientists here seem to think...
Me, for example. Am I alive? And on top of that, am I living?
Stuck in this room all day...
That's why I find waterfalls so interesting. And sunlight.
Though I've never seen either, they seem to be almost the epitome of what life is...
I do hope I'll get to see them one day.
I'm sure you will, CC.
Doctor... one of the reasons I asked you the question... now...
When we've just gotten to know each other, I...
I do think my time will be coming to an end soon.
I've only been getting worse. There was that one day I felt a little better, but...
After you put your report in, I think they updated my program.
I'm not supposed to die. I'm an experiment, after all. They can't test on me if I'm dead.
I think they made a mistake, though. Increased the program effectiveness too much.
Oh, CC... I'm so sorry.
That's why I needed you to know how I felt about you.
Before I pass.
You mean if you pass.
I always appreciate your optimism, Doctor.
Before you know it, it's almost 16:00, and it's time to clock out.
You should be going, Doctor. Miss Esther is most likely waiting for you.
Ah. Yes. Thank you, CC.
And...

You lean over CC's bed and gently place a kiss on his plates.
You... are incredible.
Thank you. I... that was lovely.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Yes, you will.
You finish your checklist and head out of his room.
Goodnight, CC.
Goodnight, Doctor. Have a good day.
You finish your checklist and head out of his room.
It's alright, Doctor. I understand.
Please, don't think I will hold animosity towards you because of this.
I hope we can remain friends, regardless.
Your shift continues on slowly. You and CC chat gently, pausing occasionally to let him rest.

You should be going, Doctor. Miss Esther is most likely waiting for you.
Ah. Yes. Thank you, CC.
You finish your checklist, say goodbye to CC, and leave his room.
At least you'll keep him entertained.
Just try not to yell at him, alright?
I'm sure you remember the way to the gym.
I do. Thank you, Miss Esther.
Doctor! It's good to see you again.
Glad you chose me for your one-on-one - I promise I won't be too much of an annoyance, haha.
Or I'll try. No guarantees, actually.
Hey Rob. Good to see you alive and active.
As usual!
So - come to work out, or...
Actually... there's something I gotta tell ya first, Doc.
Really?
Yeah! And I got somethin' for ya. Come up to my desk real quick.
You approach the gym kiosk.
This is my most prized possession - it's an authentic 1988 Topps baseball card.
Jose Canseco. The guy on the card.
It's pretty hard to find baseball cards this far down...
This one was given to me by the guy in the position before ya.
Anyway. I want you to have it now.
Rob... this seems very personal to you.
Yeah. 'Course it is. That's why I'm giving it to ya.
It's important to me. Just like... you are.
Listen, Doc, I ain't gonna beat 'round the bush -
I really like you. I haven't felt feelings this strong since my wife left me! Ha!
So. Anyway.
Wanna go out? Y'know... you n' me?

Hell yeah! You're the best, Doc.
Haha... thank you.
Now that you and I are "official"...
You should prolly know some more about me. And my ex, I guess.
He begins to ramble about his ex-wife, Celine.
She was beautiful, y'know, all orange and stuff...
Orange?
Yeah, like... well, I dunno.
But she was crazy! Yellin' at me for no reason, and she hated when I watched the game -
WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA? ARE YOU STUPID? WHY ARE YOU NOT RUNNING?!
- AND, to top it ALL OFF, that bitch fuckin' cheated on me.
That's terrible.
I know, right?! Anyway.
I'm glad you don't find my... volume too off-putting, haha.
I can be a little much, I'll admit. But I know when to tone it down!
Don't worry, Rob. I like you just the way you are.
Jeez, you really know how to flatter a core...
The rest of your shift is energizing. Rob talks more about Celine, but he also talks about you, too.
You're really somethin', Doc.
Something good, I hope.
Ha! 'Course you are.
He'll also randomly yell at the TV occassionally - but you've come to expect that from him.
Before you know it, it's 16:00, and time to pack things up.
I have to get going, Rob. But... thank you.
No prob, Doc. And - uh. Before ya go...

You lean over - making sure he's not about to go ballistic at the TV again - and kiss him lightly on the chassis.
Doc! Jeez!
Not that I didn't like it, ya just scared me, I uh... didn't see it comin'.
Haha... thanks. I liked it.
Good, because I like you.
You finish your checklist and head out for the night, waving goodbye to Rob.
Goodnight. I'll see ya tomorrow, yeah?
Of course you will, Rob.
Awesome.
You finish your checklist and head out for the night.
Ah, no, Doc, it's alright.
I'm aware I'm not for everyone!
Hell, that's why I have an ex-wife! Ha!
Speakin' of...
He begins to ramble about his ex-wife, Celine.
She was beautiful, y'know, all orange and stuff...
Orange?
Yeah, like... well, I dunno.
But she was crazy! Yellin' at me for no reason, and she hated when I watched the game -
WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA? ARE YOU STUPID? WHY ARE YOU NOT RUNNING?!
- AND, to top it ALL OFF, that bitch fuckin' cheated on me.
That's terrible.
I know, right?! Anyway.
Sorry... went off on another tangent. I meant to say...
I hope this won't, uh, tarnish our friendship, y'know?
Hope you still like me alright and all.
Don't worry, Rob. You're still a good friend to me.
Phew! Thank God.
The rest of your shift is energizing. Rob talks about sports nearly non-stop. You listen patiently.
And in 1977, both the Mariners and the Blue Jays made their debut...
You don't understand half the stuff he's saying. It doesn't bother you, though.
He'll also randomly yell at the TV occassionally - but you've come to expect that from him.
Before you know it, it's 16:00, and time to pack things up.
I have to get going, Rob. But thank you.
No problem, Doctor. I hope you have a good night! I'll see ya tomorrow.
You finish your checklist and head out for the night.
It takes no time at all to reach CC's room.
When you enter, you find him staring out his window once again.
He turns to face you.
Hello, Doctor.
Hi, CC.
As I'm sure you're well aware, I asked not to see you today.
I suppose Miss Esther had no other choice.
That's correct.
Unfortunate.
Please, show me some grace - I'd like silence.
Okay.
The shift goes by slowly, but nothing bad happens.
Generally CC stays quiet, only mumbling to himself every now and then.
He never talks to you directly.
Eventually, 16:00 comes along.
Thank you for the quiet shift, Doctor.
Have a good day.
Will do.
You finish your checklist and leave the room.
Doctor! How was your shift?
It was okay. Quiet. Boring.
That's understandable. Go ahead and finish your paperwork and check your emails.
It was alright. Just like last week's, honestly.
Glad to hear. Go ahead and finish your paperwork and check your emails.
Only two more days to go!
Thank you, Miss Esther.
endtest
You enter your room and change into your pajamas.
You reflect back on the past week,
 thinking...
You crash into your stasis chamber, ready for what the weekend could bring.
You wake up at 11:00 today. No need to wake up early.
You get changed, and decide...

You open the door to your room and step outside.
Really? You're going to stay in?
You're staying in today? There's a bunch of stuff I programmed waiting for you outside!
Lots of dialogue and character interactions and easter eggs and fun stuff!
You're sure you want to stay in?

Good choice.
You open the door to your room and step outside.
You come up to the office door.
You try to open it, but it's locked.
Miss Esther must've locked it up behind her.
You remember the email that mentioned keeping research supplies "locked" over the weekend.
I guess she took it literally...
You leave the office behind you.
You enter the cafeteria. You haven't actually been in here yet.
Even though Miss Esther mentioned it to you on your first day, you've been surviving off old protein bars and granola...
It doesn't look like this place has much better.
Gelatin... agar...
What is this?
A weird, half-solid, half-liquid texture you've never seen before greets you at the buffet.
 You...
Not gonna risk it.
You exit the cafeteria before your curiosity gets the better of you.
You pick up a paper cup and a spoon, scooping the weird gloop into it.
You open your mouth and -
Oh. It's not that bad, actually.
Kind of tastes like strawberries.
You shurg, toss out the cup, and exit the cafeteria.
You come up to the door to Biology.
It's right across the hallway from the greenhouse.
Though you're not allowed in, there's a window on the door you can look through.
Inside, you see what looks like a regular research laboratory - petri dishes, microscopes, test tubes filled with colorful liquids...
You're glad you don't have to worry about all this.
You leave Biology behind.
You come up to the large door that reads "RELAXATION CENTER", "ENTRANCE D".
From what you've heard, this is where they keep test subjects in stasis.
You open the door.
Oh! Hello. What are you doing in here? You're not a test subject.
This place is kinda off-limits to... normal... people. Or... not normal, necessarily, or...
You know what? Nevermind. It's fine.
Who are you?
Oh, me? Ah, yes, name's Wheatley, that.
It's my responsibility here to tend to all these humans in here...
Not easy, let me tell you, no way, haha.
You, uh... really shouldn't be in here, though.
They might think you're supposed to be on ice right now, and you don't want that, because then they'll...
Well, yeah.
Sorry, I was just wandering the facility.
Well, careful you don't wander into an incineration chute! Hahaha.
Okay, go, go, before they find out someone's in here.
You quickly exit the relaxation center.
You come up to the door with the words "MANUFACTURING SECTOR - EAST" painted over it.
You don't recognize this entrance, but your office in Manufacturing was on the west side.
What Miss Esther said yesterday is probably correct. - Manufacturing is really just that large.
You try to open the door, but it's locked shut for the weekend. No windows to peer into, etiher.
Dejected, you leave Manufacturing behind.
You come up to the door that reads "STASIS RECOVERY BAY" on a plaque next to it.
Not wanting to disturb anything that might be happening inside, you peer through the window.
There's two doctors standing next to a woman with black hair in a ponytail.
They're talking to her. She isn't responding.
It seems like they're inspecting her for testing.
You wonder how many other test subjects are holed up in the Relaxation Center.
When you went inside, it looked like the pods went on forever...
You leave Recovery behind.
You enter into the conference room. Kris is reading something on his screen, and the usual stock market graph is gone.
How are you, Kris?
Oh my, Doctor, you caught me off-guard.
What are you doing here? Doesn't maintenance have weekends off?
Yes, we do. I just thought I'd come visit you.
Oh. Well then, welcome in.
Thank you. How has your day been?
Fine, so far. Not much to do on my days off, so I like to read.
What kind of books do you read?
Mostly philosophy. You humans have some... very interesting ideas about life.
I was just reading some Camus.
Camus?
Absurdist philosopher. 1957 Nobel Prize... his work is an inspiration.
Many can't understand him, or his views.
I'm sure you could, though, Doctor.
I'd be interested in hearing more, I think.
Ahem. Well then.
Would you like to join me tonight for dinner in the lounge?
I may not be able to consume anything, but that would leave me free to tell you more.
No pressure, of course.

Wonderful. I'll be there tonight. You can come as well, if you'd like.
I'll keep that in mind.
Thank you, Kris.
Of course, Doctor.
Now, if you don't mind, I should refresh my knowledge for tonight.
You leave the conference room.
No worries. Perhaps another time.
The invite is still open if you decide to change your mind.
Thank you, Kris.
Of course, Doctor.
Now, if you don't mind, I would like to get back to reading.
Ah. Yes. No problem.
You leave the conference room.
Oh. Doctor. What are you doing here?
I just figured I'd stop by and say hello.
I see. You interrupted my reading, Doctor.
Oh.
I'm not very interested in having company at the moment. I hope you understand.
Yes. Alright.
You leave the conference room.
You enter into Section C8's break room. An actual human greets you this time.
Oh, you're that new temp, right?
Uh... yes, that's me.
Cool. Heath's around here somewhere. She's on your route, right?
Yeah.
I'm just about to head out, but she'll be back soon, I think.
He passes by you and leaves the room.
You decide to wait for Heath.
It doesn't take long before she bursts into the break room, out of breath.
Or something like that, having no lungs.
Ahh! Doctor!! Sorry, sorry, uh... one sec.
She's "breathing" very heavily.
I was... in a rush... to get back, I was down at the lounge... signing up for tonight, but I...
...don't... wanna miss... giving a performance in here.
Tonight? What's tonight?
Oh!
Sorry. I've caught my breath, now.
You haven't heard? Once a month, they do an open-mic at the lounge downstairs.
Open mic? Like, comedy? Or singing?
Comedy, mostly, although I usually do some of my signature tricks alongside my jokes.
Aperture? Comedy? I couldn't imagine those two words combined...
Ah, yes. It's mandatory, I think, orders from up top or something.
I know Miss Caroline has put in a lot of employee morale programs, which might have something to do with it...
Anyways, uh, Doctor, you should come watch!
It'll be fuuuun!

Great! Yes, I'd love to see you in the audience.
Now, I hate to say goodbye, but I've got to practice my tricks, and you'll be spoiled if you watch!
Oh! Yes, I'll be going.
You leave Heath behind to practice.
Oh, yeah, no worries. I'm sure you'll make it if you can!
Now, I hate to say goodbye, but I've got to practice my tricks, and you'll be spoiled if you watch!
Oh! Yes, I'll let you practice.
You leave the break room behind.
Oh... Doctor. You're here.
Isn't... today... your day off?
Yes, but I thought -
I've got to practice for tonight, so... if you could leave, that would be helpful.
Ah. Yes. Alright.
You leave the break room. Heath seems to be in a bad mood today...
You make your way through the residential block, towards CC's room.
You hope you're not disturbing him.
Once you reach his door, you listen closely.
Doesn't seem like there's anyone else in there.
You open the door carefully.
Mmm... hello?
Sorry, CC, I didn't realize you were sleeping.
Oh, don't worry, Doctor, I wasn't.
Just closing my optic for a short while, that's all.
Isn't Saturday your day off? Why are you here?
I just came to see you.
That's a little silly. You don't have any reports to do today.
I don't need reports to come visit.
Haha... fair enough.
It must get boring here on the weekends, since your management rail is cut off.
Yes, very much so.
When I was... first activated, they had a portable rail with everything I needed on it...
A large canister on the back that my tubes could be inserted into, to sustain me.
I'm not sure where it went, but... it allowed me to tour the facility, for a short while.
And you have no idea where they might have taken it?
Oh, it's probably somewhere in the area. Perhaps in a storage unit, locked away...
But yes, I'm not entirely certain.
That's unfortunate, CC. I'm sorry.
No worries, Doctor. I'm fine where I am.
Doctor... perhaps, could you come back tonight? I may have something for you.
But I need time alone to prepare it.
I'm glad. Thank you, Doctor.
Now - you should go. I need to prepare...
Oh. Yes. Thank you.
You leave CC behind in his room.
Oh, no. I understand, Doctor.
I apologize.
Now - I believe I need some rest.
Oh. Yes. Thank you.
You leave CC behind in his room.
Oh... Doctor. What are you doing here?
I just came by to see hello.
I'm sorry, but... I'm not sure I want to see you right now.
Please leave.
Ah... yes. Alright.
You quickly leave CC's room.
You approach the sliding door with the label "EMPLOYEE LOUNGE".
This door looks much different from the others - newer, and the label isn't as large.
Gregory said he'd be in here.
You enter.
The place is vibrant. Soft jazz plays over speakers above you and there are many employees milling about.
The room itself is warm and inviting, gentle wooden brown and deep red brick.
It's nothing like the rest of Aperture. It feels like you've just stepped into a different world.
On your left, a stage with dark blue curtains looms over the lounge.
That's probably where Heath will be performing tonight.
On your right, a bar. Gregory is... "sitting" at one of the stools.
You go over to greet him.
Ahh, Doctor! Glad you could make it. Sit down for a bit, yeah?
You sit down next to him.
So... want a drink?
I don't know what you humans consume, but... I'm guessing it's not lighter fluid.
No, haha, that would kill us.
Well. Most of us.
Well, I think they have a lot to choose from, so...
You havin' anything, Doc?

Aww, that's a shame. But I guess it's not for everyone.
The greenhouse doesn't grow oranges. Is apple juice okay?
Yes, that's fine.
I think so. Gimme a minute.
Thanks.
Anyway, the reason I invited you out, uh...
You've probably been hearing some things... from Rob, from Miss Esther...
That I'm pretending to be something I'm not, I guess?
And I wanna clear things up.
Pretending to be something you're not?
Yeah! Like, the trench coat, for example, it's...
It's just a fashion statement, y'know? Makes me... stand apart from other cores.
He laughs nervously.
I-I'm not hiding anything under it. And I'm CERTAINLY NOT three different cores, in secret.
I can uh... I can guarantee you that much.
I'm not sure where Rob got that idea from, but...
So please, uh...
Don't think I'm weird, Doctor.

O-Oh. That's... that's great to hear. Umm...
So... anyways. What do you like to do... in your free time?
My free time?
I don't really have a lot of it...
After work, I guess I just go right to bed.
Doesn't maintenance only get off work at 4, though?
That's still lots of time to do other stuff!
I guess. I never really thought about it.
What about you?
Me?! Uh... um. No one's asked me what I like before, so, uh...
I guess I like sports a little. Rob tells me a lot about them, and they seem interesting enough.
Have you seen Heath's magic tricks? I like those too. Real impressive.
I guess I'm kinda just a people person. In a way. Not to say I'm... people. But.
I just... really like getting to know everyone here in Aperture.
I'm still a fairly new core. I was only activated about a year ago, so... I still got a lot to learn.
And the best way to do that is by meeting new people!
That's great, Gregory.
Oh - wait a minute -
Gregory looks down and begins speaking softly.
No, I need to you go closer!!
Less left, more right! Come on!
T-They're looking at us, we need to move!
I'm so sorry Doctor, can you give me just a minute?
What are you doing down there?! Activate the panel!
Suddenly, Gregory lurches closer to you. You back up a bit.
S-Sorry, Doc, hard to... control my speed.
How do you move without a management rail?
Oh, quite simple really. There's a - uh, a panel below me that I'm connected to. The cart carries me around.
The engineers just - forgot to install my rail attachment system, so... they had to make do, y'know?
Anyways. I should get going, Doctor. It was nice chatting, and... all that.
And with that, he's gone.
You get up and head out of the lounge.
You enter into the greenhouse with caution, making sure no other employees are here to yell at you.
The lights are back to normal, thankfully, and most of the plants look fine.
Aspen's in the corner, meticulously mending to a flowering species.
Aspen?
AAH! Doctor! Oh please, don't scare me like that!
I-Isn't today your day off? What are you doing here?
I just figured I'd stop by and make sure everything's okay in here now.
Oh, oh, yes! You must've sent that email to Facilities - everything's back up and running!
Thank you, thank you, uh...
I'm so sorry. I really didn't expect anyone else to be in here.
I'm the only one that stays over the weekend.
Really? Doesn't this place take a lot of work to maintain?
Only when the specimens are constantly being tested on.
Over the weekend, none of the scientists are here...
...and the plants are happy. It's peaceful.
They have feelings, you know, and - not that I don't get it, but...
Sometimes I wish they wouldn't test so much on them.
I understand.
I feel like Bertha is trying to tell me things sometimes.
See, I knew you'd get me.
Say, uh, Doctor...
You normally aren't here when this happens, but...
We have a sample of dinoflagellates in the lab for the next few days.
It's a bioluminescent algae. They emit this beautiful blue-green glow in the dark.
If you'd like, and you're not busy, would you like to stop by during the artificial night cycle tonight?

Oh, wonderful, wonderful, haha.
You should leave now - staying too long could get you in trouble.
I don't want that.
Oh. Yes, I'll leave.
I hope I'll see you tonight, Doctor.
You leave the greenhouse and carefully close the door behind you.
Oh, no worries at all. I get it.
There's always another time.
You should leave now - staying too long could get you in trouble.
We don't want that.
Oh. Yes, I'll leave.
I hope I'll see you tonight, Doctor, regardless!
You leave the greenhouse and carefully close the door behind you.
Ah, yes. Facilities contacted me personally, so you didn't need to send an email.
Everything's working fine, but...
You really shouldn't be here outside of working hours, Doctor.
You could contaminate the specimens. And I don't think you're approved to be in here off-hours anyway.
Oh. Yes, sorry. I'll go.
Ah, thank you. I'll see you on Monday.
You leave the greenhouse and carefully close the door behind you.
You enter into the gym. There's actually people in here today, one on the treadmill and one on the rowing machine.
Ah, Doc. Happy Saturday. Come to work out?
Kind of. I also just wanted to check up on you.
Ah, that's kind of you. 'Specially on your day off - you didn't need to come see me.
Yeah, but I wanted to.
Well, then.
Don't flatter me too much now, haha.
I'm getting ready for the big game tonight. Been waiting for this one for a long time...
SuperBowl. Bengals v. 49ers. Technically it aired a few months ago, but...
Aperture's so far down that I'm getting the programming super late.
Not to mention they don't really... prioritize TV here. Obviously.
Hey... you wouldn't wanna join me for that game, would ya?
I probably got a chair 'round here somewhere...
You've seen me yell at the screen all week - now's your chance to join!

Killer! Can't wait. It's gonna be great.
HELLO?? ARE YOU EVEN PAYING ATTENTION? WHERE'S YOUR DRIVE?!
Sorry, sorry.
Yeah, I hope you'll stop in and watch with me.
Now I hate to do this, but I don't want you distracting the other people here, so...
Hop on a machine or head on out.
Ah, yeah. I have other stuff to do, so I think I'll pass, haha.
Ah, no worries. Catch ya tonight, right?
Hahaha. Get it? Catch?
Speaking of -
CATCH IT! CATCH THE BALL! COME ONNNN, COMMIT, COMMIT!
Laughing to yourself, you leave the gym behind.
Ah yeah, got other stuff, prolly.
I get it.
My ex said the saaame exact thing before she started CHEATING on me...
"Can't come home tonight honey, I've got plans..."
YEAH CELINE?? PLANS WITH JEREMY, HUH?? SCREW YOU, WOMAN!
EVERYTHING I DID FOR YOU, AND WHAT DO I GET?
You back out of the gym carefully, leaving him to his ranting.
Check up on me? Why, have I done something wrong again?
No, it's just -
Listen, Saturday's my busiest day. Still not a lot of people, but more than the usual zero.
I don't really got time to chit-chat, so -
KICK IT! KICK IT, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR, YOU HAVE A PERFECT SHOT!
- so either you're here to use the machines or not.
I think I'll just leave, then.
Pfft. Don't blame me when you wither away at 40!!
You back out of the gym before Rob gets any angrier.
You walk down one of the residential block's halls.
The coordinates that core sent you for his "place" lead to the end of this hallway.
You reach a door that looks like it's been abandoned for who-knows-how-long.
You knock.
The door slides open and you-know-who greets you.
Who's... who's there?
Doc? That you?
Yes, it's me. Glad to see you sent the correct coords.
Mmm. Come on in.
Welcome to my... humble little abode. Can I get you a drink?
He wasn't kidding - the closet is unusually large, about the size of a bathroom.
One wall holds a charging port while the other is filled with empty lighter fluid bottles.
The place is a mess.
There's trash on the floor, and dust everywhere.
There's also something in the corner.
You cough.
Doc? You alright?
Y-Yeah, it's just really dusty in here.
S-Sorry, it's been a long time since I've had a human in here...
I'm not attached to the system, so I can't call for janitors.
It's alright. And no, I don't need a drink.
I already got one from the lounge.
Your loss, kid, but.
Thanks for stoppin' in. Long time since I had company.
You look around the room again. The figure in the corner catches your eye.
Hey... what's that?
Oh, that thing? It was stuffed in here when I broke into the place. Weird canister on the back.
When you unfold it, it kinda looks like a wheelchair.
You pick it up and open it. On the back, there's a label - "C.C.T.V."
CCTV? Like... surveillance system?
Same acronym, but I don't think so... mind if I take this?
Sure, I don't care.
Thanks.
You set the CCTV outside for now.
You look around the room again. The shelf catches your eye.
So... lots of lighter fluid, huh?
Uh... yeah. I dunno, I started usin' it, like, I don't know how long ago, but...
I guess I just never stopped.
Why do you use it?
I don't rightly know. I suppose it's 'cuz when I don't drink it every night I start malfunctioning...
Vision gets all blurry... and I got this pounding pain in my chassis, too...
Probably withdrawal symptoms.
With... huh?
You're addicted to the stuff, so your system doesn't know how to function without it.
You haven't always used lighter fluid, right?
Well... yeah. Back when I was... cleaner, and I... remembered my name...
I didn't use it at all...
I... miss those days sometimes.
I don't really even know who I am now. Or where I am half the time.
Hell, just yesterday I'd burst into that poor CC's room and I was such a nuisance...
But it's hard.
I... can't remember. I know it wasn't always like this, but...
I can't think straight much anymore.
I know you're trying. I think you could do it.
Do what?
Quit.
Yeah.
Thanks for inviting me, but I should really get going.
Ah, no, I understand. Have a... good day, Doc. Thanks again for stopping in. And talking to me.
You leave his room and dust yourself off.
The CCTV is waiting for you here - you almost forgot about it.
You pick it up and take it with you.
Doc? Didn't I take away my invite?
Yes, but -
Yes but 'nuthin. Scram. I don't wanna see your face anymore.
Uh -
He slides the door back down in your face.
Guess that was a waste of time.
It's getting late. What's your plans for tonight?
You decide to just head in for the night.
It was fun to explore the facility, though.
You change into your pajamas and head to bed.
You enter into the lounge and look around.
The place is vibrant. Soft jazz plays over speakers above you and there are many employees milling about.
The room itself is warm and inviting, gentle wooden brown and deep red brick.
It's nothing like the rest of Aperture. It feels like you've just stepped into a different world.
On your left, a stage with dark blue curtains looms over the lounge.
That's most likely where Heath will be holding her "performance".
The bartender greets you once more.
Welcome back. Here for the open-mic?
Not really - I'm having dinner with a... friend.
Ah. A friend. The tables are right over that way.
Thanks.
You make your way over to the tables facing the stage.
Kris is sitting in the corner. It seems there's a separate area for cores.
The entire section has management rails coming out from the walls.
Ah, Doctor.
Please, sit. I've been looking forward to this.
You take a seat. There's a plate and a set of silverware in front of you.
You got me utensils?
Ah. Yes. I asked the waiter to set them up just in case you came. I can't... use forks and such, but I'm aware you have to.
I can see you got yourself a can of lighter fluid, as well.
A distilled variant. I don't drink often. Only on... special occasions.
Well, I'm flattered you consider this dinner special.
Of course I do.
What do you think of the lounge? It's fairly new, I believe.
I wasn't in this section when I was activated, but this place wasn't here when I was transferred over.
Not entirely sure when they put it in, but...

Aha, yes, very true.
So, uh... why'd you invite me out tonight?
The scene fades to Kris looking at you, lit by candlelight.
Mmm. Quite simple, Doctor.
You're incredibly intriguing. I don't get to know much about you in our day-to-day.
Plus, it's not like we have much time to chat throughout the week, given your busy schedule.
And, on top of all this, you'll be gone in another week.
I'm simply taking the opportunity I've been given.
You wouldn't fault me for that, would you?
Of course not. And I think it is very kind of you to invite me out tonight, Kris.
I honestly don't leave my room much. Manufacturing is... exhausting.
I'm sure. It must be nice to have a break from that fast-paced environment.
Yes, but Miss Esther still keeps me moving.
She was like that with the last employee, as well.
Whatever happened to my predecessor, anyway?
No one's really quite sure.
He just disappeared one day. No one seems to know what happened.
Come to think of it, though, Beatrice disappeared around the same time...
Beatrice?
Another core that used to be in our section. She managed the swimming pool.
Swimming pool?!
Yes. It's been shut down since she left... I believe they drained all the water, as well.
It's a shame, really. She was very polite.
Interesting.
Enough negative talk, though, Doctor. Let's enjoy ourselves, yes?
The night is exciting - you watch the open-mic performances while conversing with Kris.
You even get to see Heath on the stage, although you're a little too busy with Kris to pay much attention.
Heath even makes a surprise appearance, though you're a little too busy with Kris to pay much attention.
He tells you about Camus' teachings about absurdism. It's interesting.
The night comes to a swift end.
Thank you, Kris. This was incredible.
Of course, Doctor. It was a pleasure.
I... enjoy your company.
Now. I believe my systems are malfunctioning, so I should be going.
I need to check my coolant levels. I think I'm overheating.
Of course.
I will see you on Monday, Doctor.
And with that, he disappears back into the walls behind the lounge.
You get up, thank the bartender and your waiter (even though you didn't order anything), and leave to go to bed.
You enter into the lounge and look around.
The place is vibrant. Soft jazz plays over speakers above you and there are many employees milling about.
The room itself is warm and inviting, gentle wooden brown and deep red brick.
It's nothing like the rest of Aperture. It feels like you've just stepped into a different world.
On your left, a stage with dark blue curtains looms over the lounge.
That's most likely where Heath will be holding her "performance".
The bartender greets you once more.
Welcome back. Here for the open-mic?
Yes, but I'm not performing. Just watching.
You can take a seat at any of the tables over there.
Thanks.
You make your way over to the tables facing the stage.
Kris is at a table on the other side of the room. Seems like there's a specific section that management rails go to.
It's separated from the rest of the "human" tables.
You sit down fairly close to the stage.
After a short while, an employee enters through the curtains.
Welcome, Aperture employees!
Just a reminder that if you are here and aren't an Aperture employee, we do have cause to escort you and/or erase your memory of this facility.
Anyways!
Today is the Saturday open mic, and we have several performers here, some new, some returning.
Please sit back and relax, if you can, and enjoy!
Brought to you by the Employee Morale Program.
The room gently applauds him as he exits the stage.
The first few showcases are interesting, though not what you came here for.
Someone brings a turret onstage and does a duet with it.
Another person shows off an infinite backflip using a portal gun.
Yet another performs slam poetry about feeling trapped in their cubicle.
All in all, it's very interesting.
Next up - Magic Core, Heath!
The room applauds gently once more, and Heath comes out through the curtains.
She approaches the microphone, and a spotlight comes up on her.
Hello, Aperture! I'm glad to be on this stage once more!
Say - I was just in the cafeteria the other day, and - just so you know - I'm allergic to peanuts.
The room is silent. A single cough.
I asked the chef if the cake they were serving had nuts in it - he said no!
When I took a bite, I immediately had to spit it out!
I guess you could say... the cake was a lie!
A single chuckle. You don't get it.
Maybe the joke would make more sense if a human told it?
You know, Aperture was built in a giant salt mine.
I guess they didn't call him "CAVE" Johnson for nothing!
A couple more laughs.
That one was pretty good.
Okay, okay, give me one more chance - this one's a good one.
What does a robot do after a one-night stand?
Silence. Bated breath.
He nuts and bolts!
You laugh. A good bit of laughter fills the room.
Heath looks very happy.
She continues for a bit, and her jokes get more laughter each time.
Eventually, she takes her bow.
Thank you, thank you! I'll be here next week with some more!
Gentle clapping fills the room again. Heath disappears into the curtains.
She suddenly appears out from a wall beside you.
Heath! I didn't know the walls in here were panels...
Haha, yeah, they're disguised as wood, but they're actually hiding a bunch of management rails back here.
So! What'd you think of my show?
I didn't know you told jokes on top of doing magic. I thought you were going to perform some tricks.
Ah, haha, I like to experiment with what I do each time.

Ah, yeah, I'm always a little nervous to start.
You? Nervous?
Don't tell anyone!
I'm glad you liked the show. Thanks for coming, Doctor.
As soon as I came out, I looked around for you. I was so happy to see you in the audience.
Heath, I...
Ah! Hahaha! I should go! Need my beauty sleep!
And I think my chassis is - overheating.
But -
And she's gone.
You get up, compose yourself, and head back to your room to end the night.
You enter into the greenhouse, which much darker inside than usual.
It's almost dead-silent - no hissing of sprinklers or whirring of Aspen's management rail.
It's a little terrifying.
Aspen?
Silence. You wonder if he decided to just call it a night.
Aspen, I'm -
You step forward and look to your left. The door that's usually closed on the far side of the room is now open, and a soft blue light is emanating from within.
You approach the door cautiously.
Aspen?
You step into the room to see Aspen looking down at a water pool.
Manufactured waves ebb and flow across the surface, moving the algae.
Doctor! Glad you could make it.
Isn't it beautiful? Haha.
Wow.
The algae glow a vibrant blue-green light, unlike anything you've ever seen.
I mean, I'm sure you've seen things glow before, but... this is different, yes?
Pyrodinium bahamense. That's their binomial name.
But a lot of us just refer to them by their superclass.
I personally think using their full name can be important...
There's so many different species, after all.
They're on loan to us from Marine Studies. We generally don't carry much sea life in Botany.
It's a rare treat.
I'm glad you're here.
Aspen, this... is beautiful.
I'm really happy you could make it. I was excited to show you this.
You've shown a lot of interest in plant life, something I'm really passionate about...
I just hope you know that I really appreciate you, Doctor.
I appreciate you too, Aspen. It's been wonderful to learn what little you've shown me.
I'd honestly be interested in hearing even more.
It's such a shame that you're only here for one more week.
I have so much to tell you...
I promise I'll come by and visit. Then you can tell me as much as you'd like.
No, that can't work. Once you're back in Manufacturing, you won't be permitted to come into the greenhouse.
And I'm not permitted to leave...
Which just means I'll need to take every opportunity I can to teach you!
Under the light of the algae, Aspen begins rattling off about every botany fact they can think of.
It's a lot. How they know so much, you'll never understand.
You suppose it's just the passion they have for the craft.
Before long, you've been here for over an hour, just listening to them.
Oh, uh, Doctor, I'm incredibly sorry, it seems I've kept you here way too late.
Ah, yes. I didn't realize how tired I was until just now, haha.
I know you need your rest and everything, so...
Thank you. Again. For visiting me. It's always... so good to be with you.
I can't wait to see you again on Monday.
Likewise.
You hesistate, but leave the greenhouse behind and head to bed.
You approach the door to the gym. It's mostly dark through the window, although you can see a faint light through the frosted glass.
On the door is a sign that says "CLOSED FOR REPAIRS".
Yeah, right.
You knock.
Uh, sorry, we're closed!! The sign?? Hello?
Rob, it's me.
Agh!! Doctor! One sec, one sec...
There's a bit of light crashing before you hear the whirring of a door lock.
Should be open now, come on in!
You open the door and step in.
Just like you thought, the faint light you saw from outside the window was, in fact, the TV.
Glad ya came, Doc. I was just about to start the game.
Take a seat! Take a seat.
You sit down and look up at the TV.
I've been meaning to ask why your TVs are in such a weird aspect ratio.
Isn't that the same size most of the new monitors are?
Ah, yeah. The boss wanted this newly-invented "widescreen" put into everything - our TVs, monitors...
That man loved anything with "science" in it...
Another reason barely anyone comes in here. Everyone's too obsessed with science thanks to that brute.
Well, not everyone. I'm more interested in engineering than whatever they do up in testing.
Prolly why you and I get along so well.
Anyway, the people up on the surface still haven't all switched over to widescreen, so...
...all my programs are still in the usual 4 by 3. Sorry.
Oh no, it's okay.
You hear a click sound, and the playback on the television starts.
Do you want the heavy favorite, the San Francisco 49ers, going for their third Super Bowl win this decade...
...or the underdogs by 7 points, the Cincinnati Bengals, trying to celebrate their 200th year as an American city with their first Super Bowl win?
The announcer welcomes you to the Superbowl XXIII.
Y'know, Doc, I don't think anyone's ever sat down to watch a game with me.
So... in a way, this is kind of a date, huh?
Haha. Maybe.
Well. Hope my temper doesn't scare ya too bad.
Oh - check it out, the game's startin'.
You don't understand a lot about what you're watching, but it doesn't bother you too much.
GO! GO! COME ON, YOU GOT THIS!
Rob's energy is contagious. Before you know it, you've joined in.
YOU'RE ALMOST THERE, COME ON!
HELL YEAH!
Touchdown!!
The scene fades to a dark room lit by a TV screen. Rob turns back to look at you.
Now you're getting into it, Doc.
Never thought you'd be one to yell.
What can I say? You got me pumped up.
Hahaha! I'm so glad. Thanks for joinin' me tonight.
You really didn't have to, but...
S'been a long time since I last had some proper company.
So I appreciate it.
The game's exciting. Rob explains the basics of football to you so you can keep up with what's going on.
Before you know it, the game's over.
YEAH!! 49ERS TAKE IT!
That's my team right there. I've been so hyped for the Superbowl 'cuz they made it all the way this year.
Anyway. That's all, Doc. Game's over.
Aw, that's too bad. I was having fun.
There's always more - you can stop in any time to join me.
Please don't hesitate, Doc. I really enjoy your company.
Yours too, Rob. Your energy's infectious.
Haha! I'm glad.
Welp. I guess I'll catch you on Monday, then.
Guess so.
You get up to leave the gym.
Wait - Doc.
What's up?
Thanks for not judging me. A lot of the other cores... they think I'm too loud. Too crazy...
Hell, my ex-wife left me cuz of that.
Sports are my passion, and she just... couldn't really accept that.
It feels good to have someone who does around now.
Of course, Rob.
Goodnight, Doc.
Goodnight.
You leave the gym and head back to your room.
You approach CC's door. It's quiet. You knock.
CC, it's me.
Doctor. Come in, please.
You slowly open the door.
CC greets you with a raised optic. In between his chassis and his handlebars is a bouquet of red roses.
I hope this isn't too... forward, Doctor.
Aspen assisted me in acquiring the flowers, so... it wasn't entirely my work.
They remind me of you, though. In a way.
Please... accept them.
Oh, CC...
You take the bouquet from between his handlebars.
Thank you, CC. These are beautiful.
I can't believe you went out of your way just for me.
Aha... it wasn't all that easy, especially because Aspen and I can't leave our rooms, but...
We made it work.
Thank you for coming back to see me, Doctor. I was afraid you wouldn't.
Miss Esther is kind, but... I've never had any of the human scientists show me as much grace as you have.
It is truly unfortunate that you will only be here one more week.
I agree. I've really enjoyed my time in maintenance.
Doctor, please... will you stay a little longer?
I could use your company.
Of course, CC.
Thank you.
You spend the evening with CC, mostly in quiet contemplation.
Occasionally, he'll have a thought or idea he brings up to you, but otherwise you sit in silence.
I sometimes feel like my room is in a world separate from the rest of Aperture.
Because I'm so isolated, I rarely see anyone other than Miss Esther and the maintenance attendant.
It feels like I live in my own little bubble.
I understand that.
It's always a little more lively when you visit, though.
Before you know it, it's very late, and you're beginning to get tired.
Please, Doctor. If you're tired, you should go to bed.
Ah. Yes. I should.
Thank you again for coming by tonight.
I will see you on Monday.
You enter back into your room and lay down in your stasis chamber.
You set the wakeup time for 11:00, and lay down.
You decide to stay in.
You read, sleep a little, and go through your paperwork a few times.
It's generally fairly boring.
Eventually, the time comes to go to bed.
You set the wakeup time for 11:00, and lay down in your stasis chamber.
You wake up to a knocking on your door.
Disruption detected. Automatic waking sequence initiated.
You groan and lean over. The clock reads 09:43.
Who could possibly...
The knocking continues.
You get up, go over to the door, and open it with a sigh.
Miss Esther greets you.
Doctor! Doctor, so sorry to wake you.
...Miss Esther? What are you doing here?
Oh yes, I'm sorry - I was just wondering if you'd be interested in a day out with me?
Nothing terribly formal, simply an invite from a friend.

Oh! Yes. Sorry, sorry.
Give me just a minute.
You close the door and change out of your pajamas, brush your teeth and put on your shoes.
You open the door once more. Miss Esther is still waiting.
Doctor, fashionable as always. Shall we head out?
Yes, I'm ready now.
Excellent!
Miss Esther guides you down the hall, out of residential.
Most parts of recreation are closed on Sundays. I suppose it's to give everyone a day off.
Rob and Heath, for example. They're usually on a 24/7 recreational schedule, but...
Sunday affords them a day off.
That's good.
Anyway, Doctor, I just wanted to invite you out, because...
...well, we don't get all too much time to chat between all the places we have to go during your shift.
This way, we can just talk. You and I.
Uh... yeah.
Where are we headed, anyway?
Oh, just the cafeteria. I figured you might want something to eat.
Ah, yeah. I am kind of hungry.
Great! We're almost there.
You walk into the cafeteria. There's actually quite a few people in here.
There's no other cores besides Miss Esther, although that's to be expected with the mostly human fare.
Go ahead and grab yourself some food. I'll be here in the corner - not a lot of management rails to follow! Haha.
You head over to the buffet-style island in the middle of the cafeteria.
It's not very full - it seems a lot of your coworkers are early risers.
You take a look at the food.
 You decide to grab...
You grab a vegetable omelette and take it with you over to Miss Esther.
I wonder where they get the eggs...
You decide not to question it further.
You scoop some sausages onto your plate.
Need my protein.
This is probably artificial meat, but...
You walk over to Miss Esther.
Something sweet to start the day.
You grab the lemon tart and head over to Miss Esther.
Ah, Doctor. Find something you like, I presume?
Yes, I did.
Haha. Good, good.
So... how was yesterday?
Oh, I just stayed in my room and read some books.
Nothing much happened, honestly.
You had a whole campus to explore, and instead you decided to stay inside?
Well then.
Fair enough.
I explored the campus a little. Just wandered, honestly.
Fun! I'm glad you got out, Doctor.
Did you leave the section at all?
Not really. I'm kind of a homebody, so that's sort of out of my comfort zone.
Fair enough.
Doctor... I have something important to tell you.
Please listen carefully.
Uh... yes. I'm listening.
Do not get too close to the cores in your section.
It is against your contract to form strong relationships with them.
Of course, friendly banter, speaking outside of working hours... that is fine.
But any more than that and it may become an issue.
It won't turn out well for you.
Do you understand?
Uh...
Yes. I understand, Miss Esther.
Great! I'm glad we got that sorted out.
Anyway, sorry for dragging down the mood...
Miss Esther suddenly goes back to her normal self.
She speaks to you about her work and how she became a Supervisor Core.
One of many, she says, though you find it hard to believe there's truly that many at Aperture.
Supervisor Core XA3. That's me.
X-A-3?! You number all the way to the end of the alphabet?
Well, many of those codes are being used for other arbitrary reasons, but...
Yes, generally, we do. Or we did.
I'm not quite sure exactly how many of us are actually still Supervisor Cores, but...
That's neither here nor there.
Eat! What are you waiting for?
Uhh... I've kind of lost my appetite.
Oh, that's not good. I hope that wasn't my fault.

Oh. I'm sorry, Doctor.
Fair enough!
Anyways. Your work is going incredibly well. Management seems to be happy with your reports.
Well, to be honest, the work isn't very hard.
True enough, though it's one of the few jobs they only want a human to do...
A robotic supervisor is fine, but apparently I'm not effective enough on my own.
Interesting.
Thinking about it, though, we do sometimes tend to have a... bias towards members of our own species.
I suppose it only makes sense to have a robot-human team working together...
It's a good thing I like you, then, right?

I'm glad.
Yes, I suppose so.
You clear your throat and get up to put your plate away.
Thanks for inviting me out, Miss Esther, but I'm incredibly tired.
Oh yes, absolutely. Please get some rest.
Work starts again tomorrow, after all!
See you then, Doctor.
See you then.
You leave the cafeteria and head back to your room.
Oh, Doctor, you're not -
You're not insinuating -
I'm terribly sorry, Doctor, but if you're saying what I think you're saying -
I'm afraid I just can't reciprocate.
For one, I just warned you not to get too close to us...
But more importantly, I just... I just don't feel that way about anything... anyone, honestly.
I am flattered, though. I hope this won't make working together difficult.
No, I understand, Miss Esther. I apologize.
I won't bring it up again.
Thank you, Doctor.
Ah no, I understand. So sorry to bother you, Doctor.
I'll let you be, but...
First...
Doctor... I have something important to tell you.
Please listen carefully.
Uh... yes. I'm listening.
I came here to tell you...
Do not get too close to the cores in your section.
It is against your contract to form strong relationships with them.
Of course, friendly banter, speaking outside of working hours... that is fine.
But any more than that and it may become an issue.
It won't turn out well for you.
Do you understand?
Uh...
Yes. I understand, Miss Esther.
Great! I'm glad we got that sorted out.
Anyways, I'll leave you be now - get some rest for work tomorrow!
Goodbye, Doctor!
Um... goodbye.
And she's gone, as quickly as she came.
Did she really only come to give you that warning?
You feel a chill run down your spine.
You shake it off and think about going back into stasis...
...but for some reason, it just looks so... uncomfortable.
Instead, you decide to try to focus your mind on other things.
You read, sift through your paperwork... not a lot to do when you're holed up in your room like this.
