http://twitter.com/sodara9 I'd appreciate being given credit if you do end up using it! :D Would really make my day to know I helped some people out! Really hope this can help the community create some really neat ways to spice up their dialogue! http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php Github: https://github.com/SoDaRa/Kinetic-Text-Tags itch.io: https://wattson.itch.io/kinetic-text-tags Forum Post: https://lemmasoft.renai.us/forums/viewtopic.php?f=51&t=60527&sid=75b4eb1aa5212a33cbfe9b0354e5376b
The car is quiet - just the way the two of you like it.
The radio's off.
The only sounds are the gentle whirring of the car engine and the wind passing by the windows.
The scenery changes from wheat fields to forest and back again.
The sun shines through an overcast sky.
You pass by a sign -
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN - 5 MILES
University? What are we going to a university for?
Well, it's not really the uni we're going to...
You're really good at keeping secrets.
I think you're just a little dense.
Hey!
You're not wrong, haha...
The car goes quiet again, but you don't mind it.
You've learned over the past few weeks that Aspen tends to be very quiet unless there's plants nearby -
- in which case they'll gladly talk for hours.
You chuckle to yourself. They'll be very talkative today for sure.
You pull into the lot and put the car into park.
You ready?
I think so. I still don't know what's happening, though.
Hard to prepare for something I don't know anything about...
You laugh.
Oh, you're ready.
You pick up your tote bag from the backseat.
I'm going to pick you up now, alright?
A-Alright.
You gently scoop your hands underneath Aspen's chassis and lift them up and into the tote bag.
Snug, I hope?
Yeah. I'm still not used to it, but what can you do? Haha.
Perfect.
You walk up to the entrance.
Aspen - why don't you read that sign next to us?
Matthaei... Botanical...
Oh my goodness! The Matthaei Botanical Gardens!
I've heard about these - they're the closest gardens to Aperture!
Or... the closest to where Aperture used to be, haha...
I can't believe I'm actually here!
They have so many different species here... so many different types of plants... I...
Oh wow. Thank you. I-I don't even know what to say.
You're welcome, Aspen.
I've been wanting to take you here for a while now.
You know me so well.
I certainly hope I do.
The gardens are beautiful - brightly-colored flowers spot the landscape of dark green bushes and trees.
Aspen is enthralled, completely in their element.
Morning glories! I believe this one's specifically Ipomoea nil...
And flowering tobacco! Nicotiana alata!
Oh wow... they never brought any of these down into my greenhouse.
We had very few flowers... mostly ferns and bushes.
About that...
I'm sorry we couldn't save Penelope, Aspen.
Yes... I know.
It's okay.
Besides... I got out of there thanks to you.
You saved me. I couldn't have gotten out alone.
You sacrificed so much for me.
And you brought me here. To this beautiful place.
I loved my job in Aperture. I loved the plants I cared for.
But Aperture... didn't care for me very much.
You probably know this, but I never got a break.
I would spend 2 hours per night in my charging port at the back of the greenhouse...
...then wake up and water the plants the entire day.
And as much as I loved it...
I was so, so tired.
Thanks to you, though, I get to enjoy this freely...
And I get to spend time with my favourite human ever.
You're so sweet, Aspen.
Ah... ahaha... sorry. I may have gotten a little sappy there.
I love it when you talk like that.
Y-You can stop now. Your compliments overheat my systems too much.
Wow...
Allium schoenoprasum!
These are chives! Like the ones humans use for cooking!
Sometimes I wish I could smell them... or taste them!
But they're pretty just to look at.
It's pretty crazy how much botany relies on scent...
Made my job harder sometimes! Hah... haha...
Glad I wasn't one of the scientists.
How were your coworkers, anyway?
Well... the greenhouse supervisor, Dr. Olive... she was nice.
I think she was one of the only people there who actually cared about me.
She only really worked inside the greenhouse once or twice a week...
Most of her time was spent overseeing plant testing, haha.
We had a few nanobots on staff as well. Usually in the pipes, making sure the water pressure levels were consistent.
It was a small team! But hardworking.
They just... didn't supply us with enough people to... supplement for me.
Hence my lack of breaks.
I'm sorry, Aspen. That sounds difficult.
It was, but...
Hey! Zinnia elegans!
The next few hours is spent listening to Aspen reciting botany facts.
Thankfully, the garden is relatively empty, so Aspen spends most of the day out of their tote bag.
Slowly, the two of you make your way over to the garden's sprawling trails.
It feels like we've been here for hours!
Probably because we have been, Aspen.
Oh... I didn't even realize.
You were too busy enjoying yourself to realize, Aspen.
There's a human phrase - time flies when you're having fun.
I am having fun.
I'm glad.
Suddenly, Aspen looks away from you, down at the wood-paneled trail you're currently walking.
Is something wrong?
N-No. Nothing. I just...
I-I'm just so lucky to have you.
Can you imagine if you had never taken that maintenance position?
I would've... I probably would've...
They take a deep breath.
I would've died down there.
A-And I would've never experienced all of... this.
I just don't think I thank you enough.
You're... so kind to me.
Aspen...
Yes?
You're rambling again.
O-Oh! I'm so sorry! I... I really didn't mean to, I'm...
No. I like it, remember?
It's my favorite thing about you.
How passionate you get. How excitable you are.
I...
I-I really love you, you know.

O-Oh. I didn't expect...
I didn't think you were going to say it back, haha...
Why wouldn't I?
I... I don't know, I just...
Wow.
You know, you haven't called me Doctor since we left.
Would you prefer I call you Rowan?
Would you prefer I call you Lily?
Would you prefer I call you Ross?
Would you prefer I call you Avery?
Would you prefer I call you Hazel?
Would you prefer I call you Len?
Would you prefer I call you Evely?
Would you prefer I call you Lynne?
Would you prefer I call you Mo?
Would you prefer I call you Bemb?
Would you prefer I call you Cass?
Would you prefer I call you Tyler?
Would you prefer I call you John?
Would you prefer I call you Jeremy?
Would you prefer I call you Mason?
Would you prefer I call you Izzy?
You laugh.
Haha. Maybe.
That was so embarrassing.
On the contrary. I thought it was cute.
Stop.
Wait!
Look at those daisies, just off the path!
Do you think we can... go over there?
I don't see why not.
You set Aspen down in the daisy patch and lay down next to them.
Oh wow... the sun's already starting to set...
It's so beautiful.
Today's been perfect.
You've...
You've been perfect.
I hope I can keep that stellar reputation up.
I-I'm sure you will.
You're so... you're so kind to me.
So gentle.
Something a lot of people back in Aperture... weren't.
I was so lonely in there.
Not being able to leave the greenhouse... stuck in that one room my entire life...
I-It really got to me sometimes.
And now I get to look up at the sky...
And it feels like I could fall up into it any second!
I-It's crazy!
I wake up every morning next to you and every morning I'm amazed all over again.
You haven't even seen the half of it, Aspen.
I hope you'll show me everything.
I want to see everything.
I want to show you everything.
I love you.
This...
This is perfect.

YOU: "Why are you doing this, Miss Esther?
 What do you have to gain?"
YOU: "What happened to the previous employee? Were you behind that?"
YOU: "I can't believe this, Miss Esther. All this time, you were planning this?"
CORE UNDER SEVERE STRESS.
INTERNAL MECHANISMS IN CRITICAL CONDITION.

Doctor... you will... regret this.
I don't think your lover will be very happy about this... development.
Hah. It's over... for you. I've already contacted upper management. You're... done for. 
I hope you rot in android hell, where the screams of my brothers and sisters might...
...drive you...
...mad.
Doctor? I'm...
I'm not... dead.
You spared me.
I... haha. Ironically enough, I suppose I owe you my life.
But...
I cannot stay here. I have to leave, I have to hide, I...
There is nothing left for me here.
Should I stay, there is no doubt in my mind I would be...
...
Doctor. Thank you. And... I'm sorry.
You will not see me again. Goodbye.
Nothing from Miss Esther...
Oh well. I guess I'll see her tomorrow.
Maybe...
You throw down your paperwork, exhausted, and fall into your bed.
You wake up to a strange feeling in the air...
Something feels off.
Ignoring it, you grab your paperwork and leave your room. Only one more night in here...
Doctor.
I'm sure you're well aware of the warning I gave you a while back.
"Don't get too attached to the cores?"
"It won't end up well for you?"
Any of this ringing any bells?
Because you didn't heed my advice.
I have an obligation to Aperture. And, personally, I'd like to keep my job.
There is a very, very specific clause in my contract.
It tells me not to let any employee I supervise make a strong emotional connection with any of the cores in my section.
The clause prevents issues with HR.
Don't date your subordinates, doctor. It's as simple as that.
I mean, God, they're robots! We're robots!
There are SO MANY HUMANS you could have gone for instead!
But no.
You're just like the last employee.
What is WITH you humans and forming such strong emotional attachments?
To BARELY ANIMATE OBJECTS, mind you!
Oh well. It's none of my concern.
But you...
You've become a problem. One I cannot ignore.
I'm... I'm sorry, Doctor.
Doctor! I apologize for my absence yesterday...
I was trapped in my charging port - a simple code failure - but for some reason, Repair didn't come by until 6pm...
That's annoying.
Tell me about it!
But yes. I apologize.
I do have good news for you though!
Management contacted me this morning and told me the permanent employee will be starting today.
What does that mean for me, then?
Well, I hate to say, but you'll be on your way back down to Maintenance today.
I know it's very short notice, and I'm truly sorry about that, but...
I'm just following what upper management is telling me.
No, I understand. I'm sure my coworkers down there will be happy, anyways.
Suddenly, there's a knock on the door.
Oh! That must be her! Sorry, Doctor, but I need you to leave now.
It was a pleasure to work with you. Truly one of the best employees I've had in a while.
I'll... miss you. You'll be back to visit, yes?
I'll certainly try, Miss Esther.
Wonderful.
I'll see you around, Doctor.
You enter back out into the hall.
Despite the weirdly... romantic connotation of the cores you encountered, it was fairly uneventful.
Your outlook is bright.
You're glad you got to meet so many... interesting personalities.
You'll definitely be back to visit.
Credits will go here when they're ready.
I hope you've enjoyed your time here. I'll see you around.
You enter back out into the hall.
You hated that.
Personality cores are so annoying...
Maybe it's that, or maybe you're the problem.
Regardless, you can't wait to get back down to manufacturing -
- where the cores don't talk back to you.
Credits will go here when they're ready.
You take a deep breath. The room is a mess of papers and burn marks on the walls.
How you're going to explain this to management, you have no idea.
Still shaking, you gather what's left of your paperwork from off the floor.
You look at the clock.
It would be useless to try to finish your shift as normal now - it's nearly 16:00.
You sigh.
What the hell.
Defeated, but alive, you stumble your way out of your office and back to your quarters.
Your bed looks so much more unwelcoming now.
I hope Kris is doing better than I am...
I hope Heath is doing better than I am...
I hope Aspen is doing better than I am...
I hope CC is doing okay...
I hope Rob is doing better than I am...
I hope Gregory is doing better than I am...
I hope... whatever his name is... is doing better than I am.
ERROR CODE [[] EBLC 
This is a bug. If you are seeing this text please report it.
Whatever happens tomorrow...
It's bound to be better than this.
You wake with a start. Red lights fill your vision, and a grating alarm plays, almost as like it's inside your head.
Emergency detected. Automatic wake-up sequence initiated.
Please gather all vital equipment and proceed to the nearest surface elevator.
Surface elevator nearest SECTION 7, CHAMBER 14: [[] INFORMATION UNKNOWN 
Shit. Shit shit shit. Oh my god.
You get up, quickly grab your essentials, and burst out of your room.
What the hell is happening?!
Attention, all Aperture employees. Please do not panic.
Everything is under control.
Please turn in all contraband to your nearest Operation ACRI official.
Contraband? Operation ACRI? What -
...
I need to get to Kris.
I need to find Heath.
I need to get to Aspen.
I need to get CC out.
I need to get to Rob.
I need to find Gregory.
I need to find him.
ERROR CODE [[] 13LC 
This is a bug. If you are seeing this text please report it.
You approach the room where what's-his-name usually is.
The whole room is seemingly caved in.
You dig under the rubble but see no core trapped underneath.
Seems he might've made it out...
He might be somewhere else.
You leave the destruction behind.
You approach the door to the greenhouse.
You peer into the window. It looks like it's flooding, and the sprinklers are on...
And Aspen is on the ground.
Aspen!
You force the door open.
Instantly, you're soaked to the bone. Shaking off the cold, you look down to see Aspen off their management rail.
Doctor! Oh, I'm so happy to see you! The... the management rail got slippery, and I fell off, I...
What's going on out there?
I'm not really sure, but they're evacuating everyone.
Wh... why didn't my coworkers come back for me, then?
I think... I think they're only evacuating human employees.
What?
That's not important right now, though. This room is flooding and soon enough we won't be able to get this door open.
Y-You're right, Doctor. We should get out of here.
You grab Aspen by the handles and lift them up to you. They're slippery.
O-Oh, I didn't expect you to... haha... oh my.
Do you know a way out other than the surface elevators?
There's a set of stairs right behind the greenhouse - it's how they bring in fresh samples.
It's only used in rare cases though so it's not in the best condition, but...
Doesn't matter. It's our only chance. Let's go.
O-Okay. I trust you.
My... my plants, they...
I know.
Struggling to keep a hold of Aspen, you push your way out of the greenhouse doors.
You approach the door to the greenhouse.
You can't get it open - it's jammed.
You peer into the window. It looks like it's flooding, and the sprinklers are on...
But you don't see Aspen anywhere.
It seems someone from the greenhouse might've gotten them already...
You approach the door to the lounge to find a frightening sight.
Gregory's caught on the door - it seems like it's jammed shut on his trench coat.
Gregory!
O-Oh, Doctor! Can you - oh my god, can you help me?! Please!
Where are you caught on?
The... the door's jammed shut.
I was trying to get everyone else out first, but the servos failed while I was leaving...
My coat is caught in the door.
We might have to take the coat off, then.
B-But - what if someone sees?! You're the only person I've ever told, I -
Everyone else is gone. They're evacuating.
I...
We don't have much time.
O-Okay. I trust you, Doctor.
You attempt to unbutton the trench coat to free them, but it's very tight.
I think the only way to free you is to rip this off.
My favorite coat...
With all your strength, you grab the coat's fabric and rip it off them.
Gregory comes cascading down - and when they land...
W-What? What's... what's going on?
Who...
Where am I? Who are you?
Oh my god. Gregory, are you okay?!
Yeah, I'm fine.
Wait a minute - are we... separated?!
Oh no. Oh no. This can't be happening.
Great. This is just great.
I thought you... all... said you couldn't be separated?
That's what I thought, but... I suppose I was wrong.
You thought? That was my idea!
It was our idea. We thought that together.
I - ugh. We don't have time for this, we need to get out of here.
Everyone else has left. The surface elevators are probably full of people, and I don't think they'd like it if you came with me.
Probably not.
Agreed.
Stealing Aperture property.
You take off your lab coat and scoop the three small cores into it.
Any of you have any ideas?
Hmm...
The stairs!
There's stairs behind Kris' conference room.
Sometimes our stockholders will come down that way, but rarely.
It's our only choice.
Great idea, you three. Let's go.
You hurriedly adjust your grip on your coat and run back up towards the conference rooms.
You run up to the door leading to the lounge. One of your coworkers greets you.
What are you doing here?! There's no -
You... you should be going. The nearest exit elevator is by the relaxation center.
What about the lounge?
It - ugh, the roof caved in.
Is everyone okay?
No clue. I'm pretty sure the evacuation was successful, but...
It doesn't - it doesn't matter. You need to get out of here.
I'm just -
Okay. Okay, thank you.
You quickly leave the lounge behind.
You push the door open into the gym. There's a fire near one of the machines in the back.
All the TVs are flashing a warning signal - except for one.
Oh my god - Rob!!
Rob has fallen off his management rail, trapped under the TV that used to be hung up behind him.
One of his handles is broken off and his eye is twitching.
Oh my god. Rob, are you okay?!
D-Doc? Oh, haha, it is you...
I'm not doing... great, no...
Hold on. I'll get you out of there.
The fire behind him flares up threateningly.
Wait... it's dangerous. And this TV... i-it's heavy.
If you've taught me anything, I think I'll be able to lift it just fine.
You wrap your arms under the TV and push it up. Rob's right - it's incredibly heavy.
Somehow, though, you manage to get it up and push it off him.
Oh my god.
Doc... you came for me. You didn't need to do that.
Of course I did.
You pick his broken handle up off the floor.
Eh... I don't need that, hah. I got you here. That's all I need.
No, right now you need to get out of here. But that's sweet of you.
We can't take the surface elevators - I'm almost positive they won't let you up with me.
I... I think I know a different way. Y'know where Heath's break room is, yeah?
There's a staircase behind it. I've gotten complaints from visitors that they can hear me yelling from over there...
It's not a very popular entrance. Maybe 'cuz of me, haha.
But I know it leads to the surface.
Great idea, Rob. Let's get out of here.
You push the door open into the gym. There's a fire near one of the machines in the back.
All the TVs are flashing a warning signal.
Rob is nowhere to be found.
Seems he got out alright...
You approach the door to CC's room. You hear fire from inside.
CC?! Are you in there?!
Doc?! Holy cow, is that you?
What the -
There should be a spot to crawl into on the edge of the door - it's where I squeezed in.
Sure enough, there's a core-sized indent in the door that looks just big enough to fit through.
You take a quick breath, compose yourself, and climb through.
Doctor...
As soon as you enter, you're met with a very peculiar sight.
Multiple walls are on fire and all of CC's monitoring systems are off.
In addition, what's-his-name is trying - desperately - to wrangle CC off his management rail and into...
Is that the CCTV? The one I took from your room?
Uh - yeah. I broke into the office and stole it back from ya. Sorry, Doc.
Figured out after some snooping around that it used to be used for transporting CC around.
He's right. I-I had no idea it was with him this whole time, haha...
What is that thing?
It's the... uh, CCTV. Cancer Core Transportation Vehicle, or somethin' like that.
Used to be used for hauling CC around campus. Guess it got stuffed into my old closet a while back.
I'm glad it was left with you and not thrown in an incinerator...
Here, let me help you.
No, Doctor, wait. It's dangerous - the whole room is unstable.
Neither of you have hands. I'm your only hope.
I...
Okay. I trust you. But please... be careful. I wouldn't want anything to happen to you.
You better not, Doc. It's dangerous. The whole place could come crashing down any minute.
Neither of you have hands. I'm your only hope.
But...
Ugh. You're right, as usual. C'mere. But be careful - if ya got hurt, I wouldn't forgive myself.
You approach the two of them carefully.
With gentle manuvering, you successfully detach CC from both his tubes and his management rails.
Water leaks out of the tubes as you remove them from his systems.
He's heavy.
Thankfully though, you eventually get him down into the CCTV.
You should handle me like that more often, haha...
The other core looks at CC with a smirk.
Wish you were handlin' me like that, haha...
CC looks at him with a suspicious smile of sorts.
You plug the canister on the back into CC's ports and lock them in place.
Okay, Doc. Is he in alright?
I think so. No guarantees, but this is our only choice.
I... I'll be okay, you two. We need to leave. This room isn't safe.
One second.
You move over to the door and try to pry it open.
Thankfully, it gives way easily - seems it was just stuck from the outside.
I'm gonna need to get you off that management rail.
You're right. I don't think Aperture cares too much about keepin' us alive anymore...
Did they ever?
The core drops off his rail and into your arms.
Well, Doc, this is certainly one way to get acquainted...
Good catch.
Anyone got any escape plans? The elevators are probably a no-go.
It... won't be easy, with CC's chair and all, but... I do know one way.
Behind the break room, there's a set of stairs... I see people come down that way sometimes, but not often.
It's not a very well-known exit. Prolly our best bet.
Great idea. Let's go.
Broken-down core in one hand and a wheelchair-bound one in the other, you rush hurriedly to the break room area.
You approach the door to CC's room. You hear fire from inside.
CC?! Are you in there?!
There's no response.
A large CRASH resonates through the door.
The ceiling above you starts to crack.
You quickly run back and away from it before it caves in.
You enter the break room.
The stage is concave, and the curtains are on fire.
Tables are flipped over and chairs are thrown across the floor.
Heath is close to the stage, staring at the curtains.
Heath!
Oh... Doctor...
I-I... my magic supplies, my... livelihood, it's...
Heath, are you okay?
I'm fine physically, Doctor. I think. But I...
Look at my emporium. It's...
No amount of magic could fix something this devastating...
Heath, I'm so sorry. I know this is really difficult.
Yeah...
But you'll burn alive if we don't get you out of here.
Oh. Yes.
Here. Drop off your rail. I'll catch you.
But - I'm too warm for you to hold on to. You'll burn yourself.
I can't get you out of here otherwise.
You take your lab coat off your shoulders and hold it in front of you.
Here - the coat will protect me. Let's get you out of here.
Okay. I trust you.
Heath takes a deep breath...
...and jumps off her rail, into your coat.
I'm sorry, Doctor, I'm... I don't know what to think.
You're plenty magic without your supplies, Heath.
You certainly make me feel that way, regardless...
Let's get out of here.
I'm not sure they'll let me out with you in the surface elevators...
From what I've seen so far, I expect the exact opposite, in fact.
OH! Doctor! I have an idea!
The stairs! They're just behind Kris' conference rooms!
I sometimes hide behind the panels near it to surprise people, haha.
They lead to the surface. And they aren't that well-known. It's perfect!
You're a genius, Heath. Guide me there.
Aye aye, captain!
You enter the break room.
The stage is concave, and the curtains are on fire.
Tables are flipped over and chairs are thrown across the floor.
Heath, however, is nowhere to be seen.
I hope she got out okay...
You push your way into Kris' conference room.
It's a little difficult to get through the jammed door, but you make it in.
The stock market screen is on fire.
Literally.
Kris!
Doctor! Thank god you're here, I...
I don't know what's going on. I got to work, started doing my normal thing -
You know what?! I bet I was right! This is it! The "Operation ACRI" that's happening right now -
That's how they're getting rid of us, Doctor! I was right! I told you, I...
Kris, that isn't important right now.
We need to get you out of here.
Y-You're right, Doctor. I'm...
I know you're scared. I'm right here.
I've never been off my management rail before. I'm terrified.
I've got you.
Kris takes a deep breath...
...and drops off his rail.
You quickly catch him. He looks up at where he came from, worriedly.
I don't... it feels so strange to be off it, but...
We really don't have a choice.
If you're right, and they're truly trying to get rid of you...
...they won't let me out with you via the surface elevators.
Wait - I know a different way to the surface.
There's a back way. Stairs.
How do you know...
Gregory told me. They sometimes bring special guests in that way for conferences.
Quick - I'll direct you.
You push your way into Kris' conference room.
It's a little difficult to get through the jammed door, but you make it in.
Kris isn't here, though. The screen is turned off, too.
The management rail is less dusty - seems it's been used recently.
That's good - he probably got out okay.
Overly-snobby core in hand, you approach the stairs to the surface.
That's a long way up...
I'm not too heavy for you, am I?
Not at all. You're a lot lighter than I thought you'd be, actually.
The doors are open at the top...
That must be sunlight, then.
Yeah. You've never seen the doors open before?
Never.
I'm...
Kris looks away nervously.
Doctor, I'm not built for the surface. I'm not even sure what to expect.
I have no idea what's up there.
And I...
He sighs.
...all the equipment and resources required to keep me running, it's all down here with Aperture.
Even if we do escape... and make it out alive...
I'm not sure I'll be able to adapt.
Kris...
We'll figure it out. Together.
I...
Y-You're right. We should... stop stalling now. It's a... a waste of resources.
Clutching Kris tightly under your arm, you begin the ascent up the stairs.
My optics - agh, they're...
Oh my god...
Your vision is blinded by the bright light of the outside world.
It's only been about two weeks since you were last outside, but...
This... this is incredible.
I-I've been staring at a screen my whole life, when this was right above me?
...Kris has never seen the surface.
I can see why Aperture would choose to build their headquarters here. It's... it's...
Beautiful. I...
He turns to look at you.
The only thing more amazing than what's happening right now...
Is that you're here, experiencing it with me.
Kris, I...
I-I think I love you.
Wh-
You've been so kind to me, despite my... attitude.
You risked your life, gave up your job, and possibly endangered your future...
All for me.
I...
He laughs softly.
I'm so selfish.
I hope you can learn to love me as well.
Kris...
I think I've already started to.
Doctor, you...
Oh, thank you. This is... just incredible.
I'm glad, Kris.
Without much choice, you run down the road leading away from the complex.
No one notices you, thankfully.
Your home city isn't far away from here, but it's by no means a short walk. Plus, you left your car in the parking garage...
Damn it.
Eventually, night comes, and you need to rest.
You stop near a hidden clearing just a few miles away from the city limits.
Doctor, are you okay?
Yes, I'm fine. I just... I just need to sit down for a bit.
What about you? Systems still feeling alright? Everything functioning as it should?
Still doing your job, even off the clock? My, Doctor, be careful. You know, time is money.
Ha, ha.
You should rest, Doctor. It's getting late.
Thank you, Kris.
I'm a little terrified of the future...
You did just steal "Aperture property", you know.
You're no one's property, Kris. Not anymore.
Haha... I suppose so.
With you by my side, I'm certain everything will work out just fine.
We'll make it work. It won't be easy, but...
We'll make it work.
Aha! I knew it!
Told ya so, Doctor!
You sure did, Heath. You sure this way up is safe?
Positive! But...
I've never seen the light up there so bright before...
That's just sunlight, Heath.
Like... the real stuff?
Yeah. The real stuff.
Wow. I...
I can't lie, part of me is... definitely excited, haha, but I...
My whole life is down here, Doctor.
My magic emporium, my tricks, the parts of the break room I control to make confetti shoot out of the walls...
It's all down here. And it'll stay down here. And...
Well, my overclocking? I-It's really only kept in check by my management rail, hah...
I'm not sure how well I'll do disconnected from it now.
Heath...
I promise you, we'll figure it out.
And you won't have to go through it alone. I'll be here for you.
That... makes me feel a little better.
Plus, you've done plenty of tricks that don't require being connected to the system.
That I have! Haha, you've got me there, Doc.
Phew. Alright.
It's not like we got much of a choice, huh?
Yeah.
She sighs hesitantly.
Let's go.
It's so bright out here...
Oh... wow.
Your vision is blinded by the bright light of the outside world.
It's only been about two weeks since you were last outside, but...
This... this is better than the brightest spotlight!
Hahaha... I've never seen anything so... so...
Magical!
Wow...
...Heath has never seen the surface.
I-I can't get over this - the trees, it's like they make their own confetti, and...
Everything's glowing!
Oh, and Doctor! Listen to that music! Real animals!
Haha, yeah.
She turns to you with the most joyous look you've ever seen from her.
And... your face! It's...
Oh, it's so much easier to see in the sunlight, Doctor.
You're beautiful, you're...
Oh...
She pauses.
I'm pretty sure I'm in love with you.
You're just so... wow.
Went out of your way to save me instead of just saving yourself...
Honestly, you say I put myself in danger, but you're one to talk!
I-I know it's quite early, and we still have to get to know each other, Doctor...
But I... I want you to love me too, one day.
I think... I think I will, Heath.
Without much choice on where to go, you quickly wrap Heath up and rush down the road leading away from Aperture.
You don't dare look back.
Heath is heavy, and you're exhausted from the adrenaline rush...
And, stupidly, you'd left your car at the complex.
Damn it.
Eventually, you reach a clearing just outside the city limits, and decide to rest for a bit.
Doctor... you should really sit down, you know.
Not everyone has as much energy as I do! Haha.
Heath, you're... you're smoking.
Oh! Well, I knew I was hot, but...
N-No. Literally.
Oh. Haha, that just happens sometimes.
Nothing to be concerned about. We'll find some water and dunk me in there. That'll probably help cool me off.
You promise you're going to be alright?
Yeah. Trust me, Doc, the, uh...
"GREAT AND AMAZING HEATH!" knows her limits!
Haha. You're funny.
I know.
...
...I'm worried, Doc. Aperture's not going to come looking for me, are they?
Doubtful. I don't think they really care what happens to you guys now...
But even if they did, I'd be here to protect you.
I won't let anything happen to you, Heath.
Well then. I hope you're ready for a lot more tricks from yours truly!
Oh, don't worry. I know what I got myself into.
H-Here it is.
I'm not sure we're supposed to use these -
Actually, we're probably definitely not supposed to use these, haha.
B-But I don't think we have any other choice, so...
No. We really don't.
Doctor - wait. Wait wait.
What's up?
I... I don't know what to expect up there.
And I'm terrified.
Hah... I mean... other than when I was activated, this is my first time outside the greenhouse...
Let alone somewhere even farther than that.
I have no... I have no frame of reference, I have no experience...
What am I supposed to do?
You do have a frame of reference, Aspen.
Plants are your specialty.
And if I know anything about the surface, there's a hell of a lot of them up there.
I... I suppose you're right, Doctor.
And I'm going to be here for you the entire time.
I promise I won't leave your side.
O-Okay. I...
I think I'm ready, then.
I... I can't wait to see what real grass looks like.
Steeling yourself, you hold tighter onto Aspen and begin the ascent.
Agh, it's just like when the greenhouse lights turn on...
I... oh my god!
Your vision is blinded by the bright light of the outside world.
It's only been about two weeks since you were last outside, but...
The sky! The grass! The... oh, Pinus strobus...
It's all so bright... and so green... and so beautiful!
...Aspen has never seen the surface.
Wow, this is incredible! I can't...
Doctor, can you set me down in the grass?
You lay Aspen down in front of you. They look up and around themselves in wonder.
These - these are Taraxacum officinale, aren't they? Dandelions!
They're so plentiful. And so yellow.
And... oh, it's all so wonderful. I...
Aspen turns to look up at you.
You gave me this opportunity, Doctor.
You almost got yourself... killed... all for me. You...
You came to save me, even though it was flooding. You rushed me through fires and...
And because of that, I get to see this.
Y-You...
I think I... I think I love you, Doctor.
A-And I know that's a little strange to hear from a core like me, haha, so I understand if you...
They sigh.
I hope you'll feel the same. One day.
I think I've already started to, Aspen.
Without much choice, you pick Aspen up and begin running.
The trek from the facility to the neighboring city is a long one.
You regret that you left your car behind.
Damn it.
As you're pushing through the forest alongside the road, Aspen points out specimens they recognize.
Cephalanthus occidentalis! Buttonbush! They said it'd be too expensive to care for down in the greenhouse...
And Osmundastrum - cinnamon ferns. Oh, wow. There's so many different species out here.
You chuckle to yourself as they talk. Though you're exhausted, Aspen's excited rambling gives you a little energy.
Eventually, you reach a clearing just on the outskirts of the city.
Phew... let's rest here for a bit.
Y-Yeah. You look so tired, Doctor.
Hah. I am.
Then let's rest for a bit.
You close your eyes and place Aspen next to you.
...
Doctor... I'm still so scared.
This is wonderful... being here with you, and seeing all this natural beauty, and being out of that cramped little room...
But... Aperture's going to come looking for us, aren't they?
I don't think they will. It's not in their interest anymore.
From what I picked up, that whole emergency - Operation "ACRI" - was them trying to get rid of you.
Frankly, I don't think they care what happens.
That... makes me feel a little better, I suppose.
What are we supposed to do now though?
Both of us are out a job...
I'll find another one.
We'll just have to... figure it out, I guess.
Okay.
I think I can handle that.
As long as you're here with me.
Don't worry, Aspen. I'm not going anywhere.
They're heavy. Heavier than you thought they would be.
Doctor, are you alright?
Y-Yes, I'm just... I'm just exhausted.
We're almost outta here. The stairs are just around the corner.
You push forward slowly. Eventually, you finally reach the stairs.
Alright. We're... we're here.
Okay. How are we gonna get you up, CC?
My chair has wheels that should be able to go up stairs...
But I'm not sure you'll be able to take us both at the same time.
Take him first, Doc. He's heavier - it'll be easier to carry me up after.
Don't worry. I'll be fine.
No - what if they find you? What if they...
It's not safe. You should go up first.
Don't listen to him, Doc. Please - take him first.
CC - he's right. It'll be easier to come back for him than for you...
I'm already... quite exhausted.
CC sighs.
Okay. I trust you, uh...
Ryland.
What?
My name. I... I remembered. Yesterday.
I've just been... scared to tell anyone. 'Case I forget again.
Ryland.
That's an excellent name.
I trust you.
I'll see you at the surface.
You begin the ascent, slowly pushing CC's chair up, step by step.
It's not easy, and your arms nearly give in with every other push, but eventually, you're already halfway up.
Suddenly, you hear Ryland call out from behind you -
Doc! Hurry! They're -
HEY! There's still one over here - what do you want me to do with it?
Orders are to just throw them in the incinerator now. Boss says it's not worth the hassle.
Roger that.
CC, I -
You guys need to get goin'.
RYLAND!
I'll be fine.
Grimacing, you push CC up as quickly as you can, trying your best to ignore the scene behind you.
Doctor, do you think -
I don't know, CC. I don't... I don't know.
But we have to keep going. If they discover I have you, they'll do the same thing to you.
You're... you're right. I...
I'm sorry, CC. I know how much you cared about him.
Y-Yeah. I guess... hah. I guess that's Aperture for you.
Before you know it, you've crested the "horizon".
I-It's like the window outside my room...
Except...
Your vision is blinded by the bright light of the outside world.
It's only been about two weeks since you were last outside, but...
This is... incredible. Everything's so vibrant and bright and...
The air is so... clear.
...CC's never seen the surface.
All the poetry I've read, and none of it ever described the surface accurately.
It's... entirely different in person.
It's beautiful. It's...
He turns to look at you.
You... you came for me. To show me this.
You tried your best to save not only me, but my friend, and...
You sacrificed your job to do that. For me. So I could see this.
But...
As long as I can see you, I think I'll be okay.
I think I'm in love with you, Doctor.
And I know that's a little weird to hear from... a core such as myself. A robot. But...
I don't expect reciprocation. Deep down, I guess a part of me hopes...
...you'll feel the same one day.
I think I might, CC.
Before the people that took Ryland away can get curious, you quickly push CC's chair down and across the field, into the thick of the forest ahead.
He's heavy. The chair weighs almost half as much as you do, and pushing it for even just half an hour is incredibly taxing.
The rough terrain probably doesn't help.
You regret that you hadn't thought to get your car out of the complex.
Damn it...
Eventually, you reach a peaceful clearing just on the outskirts of the big city.
Out of breath, you lay down in the grass.
Let's... let's rest here, for a bit.
No response.
CC?
I'm... I'm here, Doctor.
I'm sorry. I'm just exhausted. And... in awe, still.
Forgive me.
Don't apologize. It's a lot to take in at once.
Yes. Yes it is.
I'm so happy you're here, Doctor. I just wish...
Yeah. Ryland.
I'm sorry I couldn't save him, I -
It's not your fault. Please don't blame yourself.
He... he told me he was finally happy, yesterday.
Said it was partially thanks to me. I...
This must be hard for you.
It is. And I'm a little scared how I'm going to... well, you understand.
Without Aperture's resources, I'm not sure how much longer I'll live.
I'll do anything to help you, CC.
You'll be okay.
Thank you, Doctor. I...
I'm so lucky.
Hey Doc, you doing good?
Y-Yes, I'm just... I'm just exhausted.
We're almost outta here. The stairs are just around the corner.
You push forward slowly. Eventually, you finally reach the stairs.
Alright. We're... we're here.
Okay. How are we gonna get you two up?
My chair has wheels that should be able to go up stairs...
But I'm not sure you'll be able to take us both at the same time.
Take him first, Doc. He's heavier - it'll be easier to carry me up after.
Don't worry. I'll be fine.
No - what if they find you? What if they...
It's not safe. You should go up first.
Plus, you're lighter - the doctor will waste less energy by taking you first.
Don't listen to him, Doc. Please - take him first.
No, CC's right. I can carry you up quicker and come back down for CC.
I'm already... quite exhausted. It'll be better to save my energy for the harder climb.
He sighs.
Okay. I trust you two.
Thank you, uh...
Ryland.
What?
My name. I... I remembered. Yesterday.
I've just been... scared to tell anyone. 'Case I forget again.
Ryland.
That's an excellent name.
I'll see you on the surface, alright?
Just don't spoil it for me.
You begin the ascent, quickly carrying Ryland up step by step.
It's not easy, and the stairs seem to go on forever... but eventually, you're already halfway up.
Suddenly, you hear CC call out from behind you -
Doctor! Hurry! They're -
HEY! There's still one over here - what do you want me to do with it?
Orders are to just throw them in the incinerator now. Boss says it's not worth the hassle.
Roger that.
Ryland, I -
You guys should hurry.
CC!
Grimacing, you carry Ryland up as quickly as you can, trying your best to ignore the scene behind you.
Doctor, do you think -
I don't know, Ryland. I don't... I don't know.
But we have to keep going. If they discover I have you, they'll do the same thing to you.
You're... you're right.
I'm sorry. I know how much he cared about you, though.
I don't think he would've wanted it any other way.
Before you know it, you've crested the "horizon".
It's so bright out here...
I can barely see a th- oh my...
Your vision is blinded by the bright light of the outside world.
It's only been about two weeks since you were last outside, but...
What the...
This is insane. I've been hiding away in a closet my whole life?!
This... this was above me? All this time?!
Haha! Wow!
...for all he knows, Ryland has never seen the surface.
This fresh air through my circuits, it's like... it's better than any drink I've had.
If only... CC could've seen this.
But...
He turns to face you.
I'm glad you're here.
You... hah, Doc, you risked your life for us both.
Not just me, but CC, too. And...
I can't thank you enough.
You're really somethin' else.
And I might love that.
I know I ain't been the best to you. I know I've been a flirt, and I've been annoying...
But I hope you'll love me back. One day. If I try hard enough.
I think... it'll take time, Ryland. But I might.
Steeling yourself for the future, you run away from the complex with Ryland before you can be followed.
You don't dare look back.
Pushing through the brush and the trees, you slowly make your way towards the city.
It's exhausting.
Eventually, you reach a quiet clearing just on the outskirts.
Wait, Doc. Let's stop here for a bit.
You look beat.
Hah. You know what I could really use right now?
A drink?
Hell yeah.
Honestly, me too. I may be tryna quit, but I sometimes wish I wasn't, hah.
I don't think I ever told you how much that means to me.
That you would try to... get yourself clean for me.
Well. Like I said, not all for you, but...
You were the... uh, "catalyst", I think the word is?
Hahaha. Yeah.
What... what are we gonna do now?
I mean. I wasn't doin' much down in Aperture, anyway.
Now we...
Now we make our own path.
Think they're gonna come looking for us?
No. I don't think they care, frankly.
I left all my keys and stuff down in the office, so it's not like I have stuff to return...
Other than me, 'course.
I don't plan to return you.
Good. I like it out here.
With you.
Alright, Doc. Here she is.
Those are some long stairs. Think ya got the leg strength for it?
Hah, you kidding me?
Maybe.
I...
Wait a sec, Doc.
We don't have a lot of time -
I know, I know, but...
I... I've never been up there, y'know.
We aren't allowed up to the surface. All I know is what I've seen on TV.
Fitness, athletics - that's my specialty.
I don't like change all that much.
And I'm... frankly, Doc, I'm kinda scared.
I understand. But there's so much up there to see.
It might be scary, but we don't have much of a choice.
And Rob?
Yeah?
I'm not leaving your side. I'll be right here the whole time.
I...
Alright.
Let's get goin'.
You pat Rob's chassis gently and begin the ascent.
What the - why's it so goddamn bright out here?!
Oh... holy cow...
Your vision is blinded by the bright light of the outside world.
It's only been about two weeks since you were last outside, but...
This is insane. Did you know about this? The sky? And... oh, the clouds, goddamn!
Hah! I've only seen this stuff through a screen!
...Rob's never seen the surface.
This is crazy! It's all real - real grass, real blue and green and...
Oh, feel that fresh air through your circuits!
...or lungs, in your case.
It's so much better than that stuffy mess of a gym...
I told you so.
You sure did! Haha!
God... I can't believe we made it out of there.
He turns to look at you.
I can't believe you got me out of there, I... hah... I can't thank you enough, Doc.
Wow. You're real pretty in this light.
Thank you.
You've got such a... glow around you, Doc. And I don't want to leave it.
I think I love ya. As silly as that sounds.
And I KNOW, I know, alright, we ain't known each other long...
I'm just hopin' you'll give me a chance.
I mean... I'm sure we'll have plenty of time now, right?
Haha. That we will.
Clutching Rob to your side, you take off towards the city.
You stay close enough to the road to know where you're going, but far enough away that no one will see you.
KEEP GOING, DOC! YOU GOT THIS! PUSH YOURSELF!
I'm pushing as hard as I can!!
The run is difficult, but Rob's encouragement does wonders.
You still regret that you left your car at the complex.
Damn it!
Alright, I think we're far 'nough away from the complex. Let's take a rest... uh, here.
The two of you reach a clearing just on the outskirts of the city.
Breathing heavily, you lean against a tree, Rob on your lap.
How you doin', Doc?
I'm alright. Adrenaline's still pumping through my veins, but I'm coming down. Slowly.
Good, good. Take a deep breath.
Rob sighs.
Still can't believe you came back for me. Celine never woulda done somethin' like that.
You're real selfless, Doc.
Thanks, Rob. I try to be.
Make sure you're lookin' out for yourself, too.
Yeah, yeah.
...
D'ya think they're gonna come lookin' for us?
No. We honestly probably saved them time by disappearing.
I don't think they care anymore. Thankfully.
Huh.
What's next, then?
Well. I'm not sure.
It's up to us to figure that out.
I should probably start by finding a new job...
That you should.
Heh...
Thanks, Doc.
I'm glad you're here.
I'm glad we met.
Here we are, Doctor.
You look down at the three cores bundled up in your coat.
This is still a little weird to me.
You're not the only one.
We have more pressing concerns right now.
Yes, you're right.
Alright. Let's -
Wait!
Wh -
Sorry, Doctor, give us just a second.
This is... a new experience.
All of this.
Being separated...
Thinking independently...
...going to the surface.
And I'm a little scared.
We've had a lot of contact with surface humans before.
In particular, the shareholders that come down for meetings.
But we've never been to the surface ourselves.
I don't know what to expect up there.
I'm not used to this... silence in my head.
How are we supposed to process this?
Separately?
I can imagine that would be quite terrifying.
Spending your whole life thinking as one entity - and now you have to think for yourselves.
It's not just that. Think about this logically -
You're basically stealing us from Aperture.
What if they come after you?
I don't think they will. I think we'll be just fine.
We don't have much of a choice, either way.
That much is accurate...
Okay.
I still think this is a bad idea.
But I'm ready.
Alright.
You hold the coat close to your stomach and begin the ascent.
It's so bright out here!
Agh, my optics -
Would you two quit whining?
Oh my god...
Your vision is blinded by the bright light of the outside world.
It's only been about two weeks since you were last outside, but...
Guys! Oh my god, look at how vibrant the sky is!
And the grass... such a beautiful green.
Pfft, I've seen better...
No you haven't.
...Gregory's never seen the surface.
This is crazy! I can't believe we've been missing this all this time!
Incredible. There's so much to see out here.
Aperture is nothing compared to this...
Wow.
The three cores turn to look at you.
Doctor, you brought us up here. You...
It's thanks to you we're seeing this right now.
You're brave. Saving us despite the risk.
You've never once judged me. You've never questioned me.
Kept our secret... and when we told you, you accepted us regardless.
Doctor...
I think I love you.
Me too.
Me three.
Hah... this is a little weird, huh?
We all still have the same feelings for you despite the separation...
It is a little strange.
Especially considering I still feel the same way I did about you before.
But we'll... figure it out.
Looking back at the complex you came from, you tie the sleeves of your coat together around Gregory and sprint off.
You keep to the forest neighboring the road, making sure to stay far enough away that no one will see you.
Thankfully, Gregory's lightweight - the three of them together are still about half the weight of a full core.
It's still a long jog, though.
You regret that you left your car back at the complex.
Damn...
Doctor - you should probably rest for a bit.
It's dangerous to push yourself too hard.
Yeah. Listen to them.
Alright, alright.
You reach a clearing just on the outskirts of the city.
Let's rest here a bit.
You lay down on the grass and unfurl your lab coat, letting Gregory see the sky once again.
Can't get over that view...
Incredible.
I can't believe we aren't in Aperture anymore.
I know, right?
It almost feels impossible.
What are we going to do now?
What should we do?
Hah! What shouldn't we do?!
Don't get ahead of yourself.
Doctor?
Yeah?
What's next?
We reach the city, dumbass.
Well yeah. I think he's asking what then?
Who knows. First things first, I get a new job. And then...
Well. I don't know.
It still feels weird being separated...
Agreed. It's a little uncomfortable.
Oh, get over yourselves. We'll get used to it.
She's right. It'll just take some time.
You three are funny.
What do you mean?
Oh, nothing.
But don't worry. We'll figure things out.
I'm sure things will be just fine with you here, Doctor.
Agreed. You're smart.
And pretty.
Haha. Thank you, guys.
Temperatures are expected to be in the high 80s today, with little to no clouds...
It's a perfect day to get out there and explore!
Sounds like we picked the right time for our vacation.
Did we ever! Oh, I'm so excited.
I wish you had told me where we're going...
That would've ruined the surprise, Heath.
But I can probably tell you now...
You slow down as you pass by the sign -
COLON - MAGIC CAPITAL OF THE WORLD
Magic capital of the...
OH MY GOD YOU DIDN'T!
I did.
Oh my god oh my god oh my god!!
I'm so excited! I can't believe!
Oh wow. You're so sweet.
I'm just surprised it was close enough that we could drive to it.
How'd you even find this place?
It wasn't easy. Took a lot of looking through papers, asking around, making a couple calls...
But it's all worth it for you.
You're more full of surprises than I am.
Don't flatter me too much, now.
Anyways. There's museums about the history of magic here, and popular magicians perform here all the time...
I figured it'd be perfect for you.
It's almost as perfect for me as you are.
Eventually, you reach the house you're looking for - a quaint little bed and breakfast just outside the town.
You park your car, take off your seatbelt, and pop the trunk.
You slide your oven mitts on - something you've had to invest in to handle Heath recently - and pick her up gently.
Cooler time.
My favorite.
You place her down carefully in a very spacious cooler you keep in the trunk.
It keeps her internal systems at a normal temperature - most of the time.
I've gotta hide you now. You'll be alright till we get up there, right?
Don't worry about me - I'm super stealthy when I want to be.
I don't believe you.
Haha, you got me.
You close the cooler lid and head up to the house entrance.
She was nice. What did she say her name was? Dolores or something?
A muffled voice comes from the cooler.
Dolly.
Ah, yes. You're right.
You place the cooler down on the bed and open the lid. Water vapor spills out.
What can I say? I'm a smokeshow no matter where I am.
Oh, stop.
This is a nice place. Very cozy. Nothing like where we came from, haha!
Our apartment isn't cozy?
Oh no! That's not what I meant at all. I - I was talking about Aperture.
Oh. Yeah. That place was kind of depressing, wasn't it?
Yeah...
But without it -
I would've never met you. And that would've been a shame.
S-Sorry.
What do you have to be sorry for?
I don't think I've thanked you enough. For saving me from that place.
You've got a different kind of magic in you. One I could never replicate, haha!
That's what I love about you.
You mean so much to me, Heath.
We should both get some rest, though. That was a pretty long drive.
Yeah, my systems are yelling at me again. I should shut down for the night.
Goodnight, Heath.
Goodnight.
You wake up and hurriedly lean over the bed to check on Heath.
Thankfully, you hear the gentle whirring of her internal mechanisms - although they're slower than they were yesterday.
They've been getting slower, and quieter, since the two of you left Aperture.
In addition, Heath herself has been slowing down as well...
She'd never admit it though.
You let her rest for a little longer.
Heath - it's time to get up.
Mmm. I'm up, I'm up. Sorry, did I sleep in?
Not at all.
Good. I'm so excited for today!
I'm sure you have lots in store for us.
You bet I do.
Give me just a second to change and we'll be on our way.
Awesome!
The museum is packed - not with people, but with magical history.
For a core that's been underground - literally - her whole life, Heath seems to know a lot about this stuff.
Percy Abbott! Not very well known, but I've heard about him.
I may or may not have combed through every record Aperture had on magic...
And a Doug Henning autograph! He's a legend of magic revival!
Wow...
Oh my god! Is that one of Houdini's props?!
Certainly you've heard of Houdini, right?
Of course I have. Everyone's heard of Houdini.
I think he's the most popular magician ever.
I used to dream I'd get to be as popular as him one day.
A little ridiculous, I know, being stuck down in Aperture and everything...
And even above the surface, we still have to hide you most of the time.
Yeah... but it's alright.
I kind of always knew it was a far-away dream.
Heath...
Heath coughs harshly.
You're burning up. We need to get you back to the cooler.
Y-Yeah. Okay.
You bundle Heath up and run her back out to your car.
You decide to head to a nearby park, where you can hopefully get some water to fill Heath's cooler.
You've been overheating a lot lately...
A little too much, huh? Haha...
What do you mean?
Oh, nothing. Just... I've been getting weaker lately.
I stay at my normal temperature less and less every day...
Hell, I have to stay in the cooler half the time...
Plus, when was the last time you actually saw me perform a trick?
You think back to the past couple weeks.
You're right. You haven't performed for a while.
I just don't have the energy anymore.
I have the mindset! I have the desire!
But not the power.
Heath, be straight with me. What are you saying?
...
I don't know how much longer I'll last, darling.
My systems are constantly giving me warnings... and no matter how much coolant you put in, it evaporates within the hour.
I can't be a burden like this forever.
And my systems won't let me.
Heath, I...
Are you saying you're... dying?
Haha... sure. In human definitions.
That probably would've been easier, huh?
Heath...
Can I... do one last trick for you?
Of course. I love your tricks.
I know you do.
Heath closes her optic and slowly opens her shell -
- Something you didn't know was possible, even with all your time in manufacturing.
What follows is perhaps the most beautiful display of colors you've ever seen from an Aperture product.
I can't use this trick usually.
It kills me. Basically.
I learned how to do it after studying my own programming for hours and hours...
...just in case the opportunity arose.
Anything for a good trick, right?
I love making people smile.
You've made me smile everyday since we left that place, Heath.
I'm sorry I couldn't -
You couldn't have done anything if you tried.
You know better than anyone that robotics can't last forever -
Especially not when you overclock them.
I love you.
And the little time I had with you...
It was the best time of my life.
When I felt the most seen.
The most loved.
I've been on stage for my entire existence...
But you were the first to look up there and see... me.
Thank you.
Thank you, Heath.
I... I love you too.
Y-You might want to let go of me now.
I'm fairly sure I explode at the end of this... trick.
You let go of Heath, lay her down in the grass looking at the sky, and back away.
And in one final, yet somehow quiet, burst -
- she's gone.
A single yellow ribbon piece left behind.
You step off the transit and take a deep breath.
It's loud. The air is bustling with the noise of cars, people, and footsteps.
It's crowded.
You clutch your luggage closer to you.
Wait just a second - we're almost there.
You check your map - the hotel is just a few blocks away.
You hurriedly start down the street, pushing past people on their way home from work.
You've never been to New York before. It's certainly something.
Might have to check out Times Square if we can.
Eventually, you come up on your hotel.
You enter.
I have a reservation for one for [name].
Ah yes, I see you right here. Give me just a second...
After some brief formalities, the desk clerk hands you your room key.
Checkout time is 11am on the 5th. If you need an extension, just call the front desk.
Thank you.
You head up to your room.
Carefully closing the door behind you, you lay your luggage on the single bed.
Okay. I think we're good now. You ready?
A muffled voice comes through your suitcase -
Ugh. I would never, EVER do this under any other circumstances...
I know, I know. I didn't really have a choice, though.
I'm surprised I wasn't too heavy...
You unzip the suitcase and pull Kris out, dusting off his chassis.
Mmm. I'm not scuffed, am I?
Just a bit. Nothing we can't polish out.
You're sweet.
He looks around the room.
This is a lot different from your apartment...
Our apartment, Kris.
Yes. I keep forgetting. Apologies. Our apartment.
New York City, huh? Or, at least, that's what the gate attendant said...
Yes, New York. The Big Apple.
The city of business, they say. One of our shareholders back at Aperture was from New York. He was very... arrogant.
That tends to be the case. And you're one to talk.
Me? Arrogant? Why, I'm the picture of humility.
Are you aware you have somewhat of a... superiority complex?
Complex? I find my superiority quite simple.
Oh, hush.
Whatever you say, sweetheart.
You lay down on the bed next to Kris.
Where are you taking me, anyway?
Like I said, that's a secret.
You're no fun.
You know, we'll have to be careful out there, Kris.
I may have been able to buff off that Aperture logo you had on you, but you're still pretty high-tech property.
I know, I know. I'm just so unique and spectacular that I'll draw attention if I'm not careful...
Sure. Let's go with that.
Most people in New York don't really care, though. Too busy with their own stuff to notice.
If anyone asks, though, just play dead. I'll say you're a prop from some obscure TV show.
A prop?! Well then. I think I'm definitely more to you than that.
Of course you are.
So... are we going anywhere today?
Pfft. No. I'm exhausted from the flight. Maybe we can order dinner or something...
Fair enough. You should rest.
Tomorrow you'll see why we flew all the way out here.
I'm excited.
Although...
Going anywhere with you is exciting.
You're such a flirt, Kris.
You love it.
Mmm. Good morning.
Good morning, Kris.
Rest well?
Yes, thank you. Next time, though, maybe don't roll onto my leg halfway through the night?
Sorry about that.
You're heavier than you think you are.
That just means there's more of me to love.
So... where are we going?
Oh, shush. Patience is a virtue, you know.
Fine.
You get up off the bed and get dressed.
Kris looks away from you diligently.
Such a gentleman.
I try to be.
Once dressed, you grab your bag from the corner.
Alright. Let's go.
You pick Kris up gently and tuck him under your shoulder, against your waist.
You click a small button on your bag, revealing a thick strap attached to it.
You wrap it around Kris and click it back into place behind your back.
Secure?
Secure.
Perfect.
You grab your room key and head out into the big city.
The trains are busy once more.
I suppose this is what we get for taking our vacation on a holiday weekend...
Thankfully, Kris' size gives the two of you quite a bit of space.
Can I know where we're going yet?
No. We're almost there, anyway.
You're so stubborn.
You used to stare at a screen for 12 hours a day. Where's that patience now?
Kris mumbles to himself, but doesn't say anything more.
Eventually, the train reaches the station you're looking for.
We're here, Kris. Are you ready?
Am I ever.
You step off the train and face the thing you came here to show him -
Wall Street.
You wouldn't -
You wouldn't - oh, you did.
This is... this is Wall Street, isn't it?
The heart of all things financial.
You bet it is.
I can't believe you flew us all the way out to New York... just to show me this.
What a generous gift.
You walk down the street slowly, letting Kris twist in your arm to see everything around him.
I've only ever seen the stock from afar.
It feels so... so strange to be here, so far from Aperture, so far from that screen I dedicated so much of my life to...
I'm in the middle of it now. This is where it all happens.
Wow.
You approach a big building with columns and statues adorning its roof.
American flags decorate the top, and four golden words adorn its face: NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE.
This is it! Haha, this is the building, this - oh, wow.
One of the oldest and largest stock exchanges in the world! And I'm right here outside it.
You're really gonna love the next bit, then.
W-What do you mean?
Well. Yours truly got us tour tickets to see the actual trading floor.
Wh - no you didn't, haha. You're pulling my... uh, leg.
I'm not messing with you, Kris.
It took some string pulling and a little bit of cash, but I managed to get us a sneak peek inside.
You're just one surprise after another.
God, I love you.
And here we are, ladies and gentlemen - the New York Stock Exchange trading floor.
You may notice it looks quite hectic down there! And you'd be right - trading isn't easy, and it's often a very fast-paced job.
You lean down to your side slightly, keeping your voice low.
Can you see alright?
A little higher?
You lift yourself up slightly.
Oh wow.
I personally don't think I'd survive down there. Too many people. Too much chaos.
Looks like my cup of tea.
You're crazy.
Maybe a little.
...
Thank you.
Hm?
For doing this for me.
For... being here for me.
I love you.
I...

I hope we can make a lot more memories together.
We will.
Oh, you finally said it, did you?
I've been thinking it for a while.
You're stubborn.
So are you.
The sun is shining. The birds are chirping... it's peaceful.
Central Park is fairly busy today, but everyone's generally worried about their own activities to notice you and your weird spherical device.
It's a beautiful day.
You lay down in the grass, near a swath of small daisies.
Unbuckling Kris from your bag, you lay him down next to you, looking at the sky.
What are these? Daisies?
Something like that. They're very prevalent in parks during the summer.
Huh. Interesting.
I'm still getting used to... not being... down there, you know.
It's still strange sometimes.
Not waking up in a charging port...
...not staring at that screen all the time...
But when I see you, it's... easier.
You're a lot more sappy than you pretend to be, you know.
I know, I know.
Can't help it... my attitude's deep in my programming.
You don't seem to mind it, though.
I like a man who's confident.
I'm not a man.
I'm well aware.
Haha... you're interesting, that's for sure.
If that brought us together, though...
I'm all the happier for it.
You make it to your room, change into your bedclothes, and prepare to sleep.
Tomorrow's the last day of the week, and maintenance doesn't work on the weekends, other than being on-call.
You're excited for your first day off, though a little curious what you'll do if you can't leave the campus.
Before you know it, you're fast asleep.
You wake with a start.
You think you were dreaming, but that's not possible in stasis.
You get up and check your wardrobe. What should you wear for Casual Friday?

You put on a regular old t-shirt and blue jeans, and head out the door to work.
You put on your best date-night attire, and head out the door to work.
You put on your vacation clothes, and head out the door to work.
You decide to just wear your uniform as regular, sling the lab coat over your shoulders, and head out the door to work.
Miss Esther is waiting for you patiently when you enter.
Ahh, Doctor. I see you went with the classic "casual" outfit today! Very nice.
Ahh, Doctor. "Casual" doesn't mean "black-tie event", but I suppose it works regardless. Dashing.
Ahh, Doctor! Planning on going on a cruise? Whatever that is...
Ahh, Doctor. Went the simple route I see? No worries. It's not for everyone.
Today's the last day of the week! Any exciting plans for the weekend?

There's plenty more to do around here than sit and read!
But it's your time off, so feel free to do whatever you wish.
Interesting. Well, it's your time off. You're free to do whatever you please.
Fair enough. I suppose you aren't used to being on-campus on your days off.
Well, we should be on our way, then. Grab your clipboard, and let's get going.
You get your paperwork and follow Miss Esther out the door.
You enter the conference room to find things much calmer than yesterday.
In fact, the screen that is usually moving so vibrantly and quickly is turned off.
Kris? Is something wrong?
Oh... Doctor.
You look... comfortable today.
You look... incredible today.
Uh... No. Nothing is wrong. Everything is alright.
Kris, your screen. It's off.
Yes, I'm aware. Financial thinks I... need to take a day away from it.
Why?
I'm not sure. Perhaps it has something to do with my... panicking yesterday.

Haha, I'm well aware.
I'm unsure exactly why they decided I needed a break, seeing as I don't work tomorrow regardless, but...
I suppose it's of no consequence.
The stock's back to normal after all...
Turns out it was a bug in the system. Go figure.
That's unfortunate, Kris. You were so worried.
Yes. Yes I was.
Uh, before you leave, Doctor...
You've been very kind to me this week. I'd just like to... extend my gratitude to you.
The man who worked your position before you, he...
Was not as... gentle as you are.
Thank you, Kris. You've been very kind yourself.
Again, I'm not sure. Perhaps that's the reasoning behind it.
Frankly, as I've told you before, I believe this is just another way to get us out of the picture...
Regardless. I won't complain about having a day off.
I just hope this doesn't become a theme.
As do I...
Sense? It makes no sense at all! In fact, the idea is frankly ridiculous.
I have been doing this for nearly 5 years now - almost half my lifespan!
I will not tolerate this disgrace to my intelligence...
You've been incredibly rude to me over the past week, Doctor...
I'm not sure what I did to upset you, but...
I don't appreciate it in the slightest.
I... should be going now. I have a schedule to keep.
Wow, I didn't even have to tell you to hurry it up this time...
You check Kris off your list for the last time this week and head out the door.
You enter into the break room. Heath isn't in the doorway this time - instead, she's waiting patiently up on the stage.
Doctor! Apologies for yesterday. Are you ready for yet another trick?
You hear what sounds like mechanics whirring, a puff of air, and then -
A cloth starts coming out of Heath's chassis. A load of differently-colored scarves.
Tada!
I don't see what the appeal of this "trick" is.
Just you wait, Miss Esther...
At least 10 meters of scarf has now exited Heath's chassis, and it's still going.
Cores aren't that large, all things considered - just slightly bigger than a small yoga ball.
Regardless, they're certainly not big enough to fit that much cloth in...
How she managed this, let alone while avoiding her circuitry, and without hands...
You're not sure.
What the -
Finally, the cloth ends. In total, it's probably around 25 meters in length.

Why, a magician never reveals her secrets, Doctor.
It isn't easy, though, that's something I can guarantee!
That was very impressive, Heath. As usual.
Thank you, thank you, Doctor. Your applause is ALWAYS appreciated!
I'm not going to lie, Heath. That actually surprised me.
Ha! I even got ice queen Miss Esther to applaud me!
By the way, Doctor...
Thank you for being so kind to me this week.
I've never had such a captive audience before.
I hope you'll keep coming by to see me.
Don't worry, Heath. I will.
You've seen better?!
Ah, I suppose human magicians have more appendages to use...
No worries! I guarantee I'll get you next time!
Maybe...
Y'know, Doc... I've really tried this week...
Pulled out all the stops so you'd enjoy my performances.
I guess not every person likes magic, though.
Ah, yes. It should be fine - I've done this trick many times over.
Concerned about me, are you?
Why Doctor, if you're not careful...
Ugh. Heath...
Yes, yes, Miss Esther, haha.
Doctor, are you ready to head out?
Ah, yes, Miss Esther. Let's go.
Suddenly, a puff of smoke comes up from the stage. After you finish coughing, you look up to find...
...Heath has disappeared.
I swear, as much as I like her, that girl gets on my nerves sometimes...
You check Heath off your checklist once more and head out of the break room.
You begin to head up towards the greenhouse with Miss Esther.
So... tomorrow. What am I allowed to do on-campus when I'm not working, anyway?
Well, there's a few locations you wouldn't be allowed into.
Storage facilities, for one. Or anywhere in the residential block.
Other than your own room, of course!
You could always check out the sect below this one. I believe the relaxation center is down there... somewhere.
That's where they keep the test subjects in stasis, yes?
Yes, although I believe they've begun to phase that program out...
Don't quote me on that, though.
Oh! There's also a lounge down there, I believe. For the humans, after they get out of stasis.
I believe the new CEO installed that only recently, with the new funds Aperture's been pulling in.
Interesting. Manufacturing is also below us, I believe, but I've never heard of there being a lounge...
Manufacturing is quite large. Perhaps you've simply never encountered it.
We're here now. Go on in.
Doctor, Doctor, now's not a really good time!
You look around the room. It's darker than usual - not a good sign for an underground greenhouse.
Is something going on?
Ahh, yeah, kind of? Haha... the artificial sunlight, pumped in from the surface...
It turned off overnight.
When I got in this morning, things were completely dark... I had to quickly report the problem to Facilities so they could fix it.
Aspen is rushing from specimen to specimen as they speak to you, frantically checking their work.
I'm afraid it was too late. And now I'm just doing clean-up before night shift gets here...

Oh, no, Doctor, this is my job. Plus, you aren't really cleared to work on this.
I appreciate it, though.
I've already sent an email to Facilities asking them to increase the sunlight output for a while, but...
...can you send them one as well? Your input might be more convincing for them.
I don't think they respect me very much...
Yes, I'll do that, Aspen.
Thank you, Doctor.
And... thank you. For your treatment of me this week.
You've been very respectful and... very kind.
I'm not used to it. It's a little strange...
But thank you.
You're welcome, Aspen.
I should be going now. Good luck in here.
I'll make sure to send that email tonight.
Yes. I'll see you on Monday, Doctor.
Oh, that's funny - no, no. They look okay from the outside, but on the inside, they're dying.
Without the sunlight for that long, and this deep into the facility...
It's dangerous. We might lose half of these specimens because of this.
Well, you're the expert, I suppose.
Yes, I am, I guess.
You're a lot like the previous maintenance employee...
He didn't care much for botany, either.
It's alright, though. It's not for everyone.
I should be going now. Good luck in here.
Yes. I'll see you on Monday, Doctor.
Doctor, welcome back. Let's head back down.
You head toward the residential block with Miss Esther.
You turn to her.
Miss Esther - you said you used to work in Testing? What was your job there?
Oh, haha, I forgot I told you that...
Yes, I was a research assistant. I helped oversee the subjects we tested on.
Unfortunately, Testing underwent budget cuts... that funding went toward "employee satisfaction" or some nonsense.
After that, a lot of personality cores were phased out of the department...
Given new titles... I'm a Supervisor Core now, for example.
Interesting. Part of the new CEO's ideal, I assume?
Most of the recent changes are exactly that.
I don't doubt her, though. She has done plenty good for Aperture.
I see.
You turn to her.
So... have you always worked in maintenance?
Mmm... no. I was a research assistant in the Testing department, when it was still at its peak.
Testing?! That's a high-level department! And they threw you down here?
Yes, but they did give me a supervisor title, so...
I suppose I can't complain too much.
You reach CC's room. Standing outside the door, you can hear muffled talking.
Is someone in there with him?
There shouldn't be anyone in there at this time -
Doctor, open the door. Carefully.
You do exactly that.
I ain't doin' anything wrong, here, am I?
Technically, you are. This is a private room. You're invading my space.
But the Doc's in here. And her little friend.
Who are you calling "little"?!
Doctor, can you please remove this core from my room?
I have nothing against him, but he is trespassing.

Fine, fine, I'm leavin'.
None of you even give a rat's ass about me...
Obviously.
You're usually pretty... soft to me, Doc. I'm sure this is a one-off.
I'll see ya... this weekend, right?
And with that, he leaves.
Seems no matter how hard I try, you simply ain't interested, Doc.
S'fine. But I take back my invite for this weekend...
And with that, he leaves.
And with that, he leaves.
S'pretty simple, honest. I thought this was my own room...
The "place" you keep inviting me back to?
Yeah, exactly that. And I don't quite remember why I thought this was my room, but...
I sympathize, sir, I really do, but this is technically a research area.
You can't just go rolling into every room you see.
Aspen told me you've rammed into the greenhouse door before as well.
Oh, so this is a recurring problem?
Doctor, I suggest we escalate this to Encoding. There seems to be something horribly wrong with this... "core."
Now wait a moment, Miss Esther. I don't think that's necessary.
I don't know your name, or your job, or your designation...
But you need to watch where you're going.
My first day here, you nearly ran into Miss Esther.
And she's right - if this continues to be a problem, I'll have to report it.
I don't want to do that.
Yeah...
Yeah, I understand, Doc.
I apologize, uh... CC, right?
Haha. Yes, that's my name.
You're forgiven.
I'll get goin' now, Doc.
You've been unusually, uh, patient with me this week.
I do reckon you'll visit me tomorrow. Hopefully.
And with that, he leaves.
Uhh... Doc, I wanna apologize to you too, for uh...
Tryin' so hard. Pushin' you too much.
I take back my invite for t'morrow. You don't gotta come.
And with that, he leaves.
I reckon I oughta be goin', then.
See y'all.
And with that, he leaves.
Ahh. Thank you, Doctor.
Are you alright, CC?
Yes, Miss Esther.
He was not a bother. Simply breaking the rules - that was all.
I honestly regret he could not stay. I enjoy any company, regardless of the type.
How are you feeling today?
The same as usual, I would say.
Maybe a little better?
You turn to Miss Esther.
Is that a good thing?
For him, yes. For us, no. A "positive" report on CC is either one where his condition has not changed or has worsened.

Haha... excuse my language, but...
Aperture bastards, that's who.
Can't leave well enough alone...
Test, test, test, that's all they do...
Now, CC, calm down. Don't get too stressed. It's bad for you.
Well then. If it's bad for me, I should keep it up, yes?
Give those idiot scientists what they want...
Ahem. Apologies, Doctor, I believe I may have gotten... out of hand, there.
Before you go...
You have been incredibly kind to me, despite that not being necessary.
I will not forget that.
Thank you, CC.
Before you go...
I'm not sure what the issue is, but...
It seems you don't like me very much, Doctor.
That's alright though. That's a common occurrence.
CC -
You should be going, now. You've been here far longer than your scheduled time.
Yes.
You finish your report and quietly leave the room.
Most likely not.
As you approach the door to the gym, you notice a surprising lack of yelling from inside it.
Rob's surprisingly quiet today. I don't hear the television active, either.
Hmm...
You open the door carefully.
Rob is sound asleep at his desk.
You've got to be kidding me.
The TV above him is turned off, as well.
There's no one else in here, though by now that seems to be the default state of things.
ROB! WAKE YOUR SORRY ASS UP!
Oh! Shit! Essie!
Sorry, I... uh.
You were SLEEPING? Do you realize we have to report this now?
Why I never...
Look! Look, I'm sorry, Essie. It gets boring as hell in here sometimes...
And I got no games to watch on Fridays 'cuz they redirect my electricity to hold meetings upstairs!
So I fell asleep. What's the big deal?

Not doing my job?!
All I do is sit here and watch the TV all day!
What "job" do I even do?! Hahaha...
I swear!! I'm alone in here all day, no one comes into this goddamn gym, and -
I DO NOT CARE! Your JOB is to watch and maintain the company gym. SLEEPING prevents you from doing that!
Do NOT talk back to the Doctor. They are your supervisor.
This is ridiculous, Rob.
Yeah, yeah. Whatever.
Now. If you're awake, the Doctor and I need to get going.
Sure.
Doc, listen...
You've been takin' me seriously. Not a lot of other doctors do that.
Sorry I fell asleep today. Won't happen again.
No problem, Rob.
I don't know what your problem is, Doc, but...
The way you talked to me this past week, I...
I dunno.
See ya.
Ahh, yeah. I suppose I shouldn't have dozed off like that.
It just gets real boring, y'know? Hardly anyone comes in here.
And they've recently started shutting off my electricity on Fridays for meetings, so I don't got any TV at the moment.
Yeah, I understand.
But I have to report this if it happens again.
I get it, Doc. Thanks.
Now. If you're awake, the Doctor and I need to get going.
Sure.
Doc, listen...
You've been takin' me seriously. Not a lot of other doctors do that.
And you've been nice. On top of that. So... thanks, yeah?
No prob, Rob.
But... I really don't know how to feel about you yet.
Seems you're flip-floppin'. Gotta make up your mind.
See ya.
Well, we have to report this. You sleeping is you not doing your job...
Regardless of the reasons behind it.
And frankly, maybe you'll take it in stride. Do your work, Rob.
Hmm. Yes'm.
Now. If you're awake, the Doctor and I need to get going.
Sure.
Doc, listen...
You've been takin' me seriously. Not a lot of other doctors do that.
So... thanks, yeah?
No problem, Rob.
Doc, listen.
It seems you don't really care for me, or the gym, or any of that shit.
That's alright, but... don't think I don't know that, yeah?
Yeah. Got it.
You end the day with your final checkmark of the week and head back towards your office.
You end your day with a note by Rob's name - "(sleeping)". You head back towards your office.
Alright, Doctor, I believe that's all!
You may have some end-of-week emails to go through, though. Other than that...
I'll see you on Monday!
Thank you for all your help, Miss Esther.
You're welcome. It's my job, after all.
DAY 1 - MONDAY. Soft lo-fi music begins to play. The scene opens on a bleak white office, with a big window on the left lighting the room.
You sigh. Another day, another dollar. But today's gonna be different.
An issue in another department has forced you to take over another employee's position for a few days.
What a downgrade... from manufacturing to maintenance...
As you carry your box to your new temporary desk, you check out your surroundings.
It's a lot different from the development level. Less messy, for sure. There's no bits of machinery strewn about the floor, no blueprints and plans sprawled across the desks.
It's a little unsettling.
You reach your new "headquarters." On the edge of the desk, there's a nametag.
The tag has "[name]" drawn on it in very hasty handwriting.
Well, at least they tried to be welcoming.
Suddenly, you hear the unmistakable sound of a personality core on a management rail. You turn to your right to see a bright, pink-eyed core zooming toward you.
Miss Esther enters into frame - a spherical robot with a white hull and pink handlebars. Her optic matches her handles, with one bright pink eye.
Why, hello there. I'm Miss Esther. I'm assuming you're the temp replacement for our missing employee, correct?

No, Miss Esther.
Oh no, I meant -
Oh! Yes, yes, my mistake. You were asking me what I meant by "missing employee".
You must have not heard, then. The employee who held this position hasn't shown up for a week.
No, I didn't hear anything about that. They just told me they needed a position filled until they could find a replacement.
Well it's of no real concern, darling. People disappear from here all the time, after all.
You're here now, so...
That's perfect. Go ahead and get your new desk set up while I go through our itinerary for today.
You begin unloading your box. You leave a space on the corner for your most prized possession...

You set down Bertha and pat down her soil slightly. She somehow survives, even with the lack of real sunlight this far down.
You place the ball carefully on a round stand so that the autograph is facing toward you.
You place the picture down gently and turn it slightly towards you.
Alright. Your job is simple.
We will tour Section C8 of the facility - that's the section you're overseeing - and ensure that all Aperture Science Personality constructs are functioning properly.
"Please ensure that the employee does not-"
Oh, sorry! That's for my eyes only. Whoops, haha.
We have five stops for today. And for... everyday, actually. It's the same route almost every morning.
Great, routine.
Check-up number 1...
Ugh. It's Kris.
What's wrong with Kris?
Nothing. He's just... you'll see. Come along.
The scene fades to a conference room.
As you enter the room of your first checkup, you look up at the wall in front of you to see a stock market display. Green and red lines dance across the screen rapidly.
In the corner of the room, intensely staring at the wall and muttering to itself, is a core, hanging by a management rail that looks like it hasn't been used in ages.
Ahem. Kris.
The core, startled by your entrance, spins around rapidly.
Kris comes into frame - though similar in appearance to Miss Esther, his primary color is a bright teal. He wears a bowtie below his eye and his handlebars are covered in fur.
Ahh, Miss Esther. I assume you're here for my checkup?
I'm here for no such thing. They, however...
Kris turns down to face you.
A new employee? Hmm. Interesting. A replacement already...
He scrutinizes you.
A little plain, isn't it?
Excuse me?
You. You're a little... boring, I suppose the word is.
Is he always this rude?
Esther sighs. You glance down at your clipboard.
I see here your job is to make sure Aperture stock doesn't get too low. Is that correct?
Yes, that's me. I'm constantly monitoring this board here.
I have stake in fifteen Fortune-500 companies, you know. I'm an expert in all things business.

Excuse me?! I don't appreciate your... implications.
Does this look easy to you? All these lines and colors and numbers??
Now, Kris. I'm sure they meant nothing by their comment.
Hmmph. Regardless, check me off your list. I'm doing everything I need to here.
Why... yes. It is quite hard.
Glad someone here has some common sense.
Esther scoffs. Kris pauses.
I apologise... for calling you... "boring".
Don't get me wrong, though. You could be doing a lot more.
You check "KRIS (BUSINESS CORE)" off your list. Seems like, despite the attitude, he does his job well enough.
Let's go, now. We have more to attend to.
I'll see you tomorrow, then.
I suppose so.
Miss Esther guides you out of the business sect and towards recreation. On your clipboard, it lists "HEATH" as your next checkup...
Our next check-up is close. Her name is Heath. She's... a little eccentric, but nowhere near as rude as Kris.
Eccentric? How so?
Just humor her, if you can.
Alright.
Miss Esther guides you into the next room, which holds a small stage with a closed curtain. Behind the drapes, you can hear crashing, banging, and...
Where is that goddamn rabbit?!
The unmistakable voice of a personality core.
Heath? Heath! It's time for your check-in.
Ah, shit. I'm on my way. One second. Is the human here yet?
Yes.
Oh. Pretend you didn't hear anything, hm?
Esther shakes her chassis in a sort of disappointed way.
Prepare yourself... for the great and amazing HEATH!
The curtains part and Heath enters the frame. Her purple handlebars are wrapped in yellow ribbon. Her optic has a purple spiral. She's a little larger than most cores.
The curtains part as a core with a purple optic and ribbon-wrapped handlebars comes barreling out. A flurry of confetti comes up from the floor and lands around it.
Mystery... intrigue... the unknown... what do all these things have in common?
ME, OF COURSE!
Are you ready for the most amazing trick you'll ever see in your feeble human existence?
Heath turns away temporarily, seemingly fiddling with something behind the curtain.
Suddenly, fire shoots up from the floor.
BOOM!! HAHA!! I just summoned FIRE with my MIND!!

Yes, thank you, thank you.
Haha!! I KNEW you had taste from the moment I laid eye on you!
I'm a true magician. It's in my wiring. And you SAW THAT!
That was inspiring, Heath. Amazing.
Mmhmm. Thank you, thank you. Not everyone appreciates my great talents.
Miss Esther groans.
You do this all day?
Yes! I'm the staff entertainer... it's my job to keep morale high and IMPRESS THE MASSES!
Well, you certainly impressed me.
Sorry to interrupt... this, but we do have more work to do...
O-Oh. I'm... the entertainer. I keep staff morale high.
I see. Is this how you achieve that?
Well, I would hope so. I'm the GREAT AND AMAZING Heath, after all.
You check "HEATH (MAGIC CORE)" off your list. Miss Esther was right - she certainly is eccentric, but morale seems high enough with her around.
Come back again tomorrow for another AMAZING SHOW!!
Haha, I certainly will!
We'll have to take a shortcut to the next location, as it's a bit far up.
Next on your clipboard is an "ASPEN".
The scene fades to a white hallway.
Miss Esther guides you to the next area, following you closely on her management rail.
Section C8 is mostly a recreational area.
Deep down in manufacturing and encoding, where you were, you might not have all the amenities afforded to more... surface-level scientists.
As she speaks, you look at your surroundings. You pass by a section labeled "RESIDENTIAL."
We have a residential section? Like, housing?
As I'm sure you're well aware, many of our staff resides on-campus in case of an emergency.
We'll pass through that area on our route, so you'll see it in a bit.
You'll also be assigned a room tonight. Maintenance staff is always on-call.
You groan.
Oh, hush. It's not all bad. Your sustenance is provided for you. We have a cafeteria, so there's no hunting required.
Sorry, hunting?
Why yes. Don't humans have to hunt for their food?
That was... hundreds of years ago. We have slaughterhouses and processing plants now.
Huh.
Suddenly, Miss Esther stops.
What the -
Coming towards her is a dirty, obviously-damaged core, not paying attention to where he's going.
Hey!
The core comes screeching to a halt.
A core comes into frame - several parts of his chassis are broken or cracked, and he's missing half a handlebar.
His entire body is stained brownish-yellow. A lighter fluid sticker is stuck to his plates.
Uhh... huh?
Who is your supervisor?!
This management rail is only approved for use by maintenance staff!!
Uhh, sorry, miss... ma'am. I don't rightly know how I... *hic* ...got here.
What is this... disgrace to my position!?

Yeah, calm down, lady. Issalright.
Are you lost?
Mmm, I guess I am, if I'm on an unapproved rail here.
Where were you headed?
Heheh, to your place, of course...
The core winks at you. Or... something adjacent to that, having only one eye.
Eugh. Disgusting. Vile.
Why don't you come drink some... *hic* lighter fluid with me, honey?
I'm... flattered, but I have to get back to work.
Your loss, but the invite's allllways available for such a pretty human...
Pfft. No. I'm... fit as a fiddle.
You have sparks flying out of you.
And what do you know?! You're just a lousy human!
EXCUSE ME, sir? This "human" has very important business to attend to and does not need the likes of YOU interrupting them.
Fine. Jesus, y'think people would have some manners...
The unnamed core spins around and hums happily to itself as it disappears back into the maze of rails behind the walls.
I have no idea why you even humoured such a... creature as that.
You shrug.
Miss Esther, visibly shaken (perhaps with anger, perhaps with confusion), continues slowly on her management rail.
Regardless. Our next stop is the greenhouse.
Greenhouse? Why do we need a greenhouse down here?
Why do we--
She scoffs.
We test more than robots here, thank you very much. Botany is just as much science as any other path.
She continues to rant about botany's importance to Aperture as you approach an unusually well-lit room.
Once you reach the entrance to the greenhouse, Miss Esther stops you.
Due to the fragile nature of our greenery, I must remain here. Only approved spheres may go past this point, and I am not one.

Haha, yes, Doctor, I'll be fine. It won't be for long.
You enter the greenhouse and are almost instantly blinded by the bright lights above you.
You look around in shock. Hundreds of plants, including some specimens you've never seen, line the floors, the walls, and the ceiling.
In the back corner, a mossy, dirt-covered core sprays the greenery with what is most likely water.
Hello?
The core stops spraying, turns around in shock, and quickly zooms back over to the entrance.
Aspen comes into frame. Their entire chassis is covered in moss, and several vines wind around their handlebars. Their optic is a bright green.
Sorry, sorry, didn't see you there!
That's alright.
I'm assuming you're the temp for the maintenance position, yeah?
Yes, that's me. I've just come to check up on you.
Well, no need for concern. My sprinkler system's working great as always.
The day it fails will be a horrible day for Aperture!
They laugh nervously.

I certainly will.
Ah, yes, i-it is. I'm glad you can see that.
Are you the only one maintaining these specimens?
Oh, not at all. Well, kind of. We've got a few nanobots on the greenhouse staff.
And of course, the scientists. But I would say I definitely work the most.
Wow, that's awesome.
Haha. Thanks.
What? What do you mean?
I just don't see what use Aperture could have for botany.
Lots of things! They test on other organics before they ever test on themselves, you know. And there's some kinds of science that can only be done on plants.
Mmm. I guess so.
I'll be leaving now. I'm sure Miss Esther is waiting for me.
Alright. I'll see you tomorrow.
You check "ASPEN (BOTANICAL CORE)" off your list. Despite the rather unusual subsection they oversee, they seem content enough with it.
As you exit the greenhouse, Miss Esther greets you.
Glad to see you're back. We should move along - that... encounter earlier put us behind schedule.
You glance down. Next on your list is something simply labeled "CC".
Miss Esther guides you down the hall, slightly quicker than before.
Before we reach our next checkup, I have to warn you... it's a little strange.
All of them have been pretty strange.
Miss Esther laughs.
Yes, but... CC is different. Not eccentric or interesting... just a little sad.
What does CC stand for, anyway?
...You'll see.
The two of you approach a room that is definitely not very well-maintained. The door looks like it's barely hanging on, and the window is so dusty you can't see through it.
You open the door gently. Inside, hanging from the ceiling by a cut-off management rail, is a core.
The room looks almost like a hospital room, with a bed and a bunch of monitoring screens. It's lacking the IV bags and sterilized equipment, though.
CC, it's time for your checkup.
CC enters the frame. His chassis is dusty, and he has several tubes coming out of his sides. His accent colors are an indigo-blue hue. He looks incredibly tired.
Oh, what's the use? The diagnosis will be the same, regardless.
Yes, I know.
The core slowly opens its optic and turns to face you. It looks... tired, somehow.
Oh. This one's new, isn't it?
Yes. This is the new temp.
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with me?
The core laughs, then coughs harshly.
I have cancer.
You look at the core, then at Miss Esther, then back at the core again.
Sorry. What?
I know, it sounds ridiculous. A robot, having a human disease. But I do.
Isn't that impossible?
Everything Aperture does is impossible.
You're just here to ensure he's still sick.
That's... that's it? No job to do, no task to maintain? I'm just making sure he's suffering?
Yes.
Yes.

Are you sure you want to choose this option? It is unnecessarily cruel and horrible.
Don't ask me. Humans can be cruel. Especially... Aperture ones.
Yes. Horrible indeed.
Does that mean you're dying?
They aren't sure. That's what they're testing.
If they wanted to test... robotic disease, or whatever... why didn't they use one of the non-sentient machines?
Don't ask me. You humans are cruel.
Well. Maybe not all of you.
CC, get some rest. Doctor, we should be going, now.
I hope you feel better.
I won't.
That's what they said when they turned me on, too.
Well, at least this makes this part of the job easy.
You're still suffering, so... mission accomplished.
You're not like the... previous employee at all.
CC, get some rest.
You check "CC" off your list. So that's what the C's stand for...
The last name on your list is a "ROB".
You and Miss Esther leave CC's room and start heading back towards your office.
The nice thing about your route is that it circles back around to your desk, which helps prevent too much time wasted walking.
Yes, I can see how that would be useful.
Our final stop of the day is the company gym.
We have a gym?
Yes. Rarely used, but yes, we have one.
Suddenly, a strangely-shaped figure comes barreling around the corner on a cart. It's headed straight towards you.
Aah!! I'm so so sorry! Watch out watch out!!
You try to move in time, but it's too late. The cart crashes into you.
Thankfully it's extremely lightweight, and you don't fall over.
You look down at the cart to see what is very clearly three cores in a trench coat.
The one at the top has a bright yellow optic, but the other two are concealed by the brown coat.
Sorry, sorry. It's hard to control this thing.
Are you - are you alright?
Me? Why, y-yes, of course, why do you ask?
It just looks like there's three -
Whoops! Got to go!!
Late for a, um, very important meeting! Yes, that's it!
With a few clicks of what's probably some sort of control panel, the cart turns and speeds off past you.
What... what was that?
That... was Gregory. He's - or, they're... or, uh...
You know what? We have more important business. Come along!
Still left with more questions than answers, you follow Miss Esther.
Eventually, you approach a door with "GYM" written on it. Not a sign of any other human employees, though.
You open the door to see a core behind a desk, red pupil twitching as it watches a TV screen above it.
The room looks like your average gym - several machines and dumbells line the walls. Multiple TV screens hang above the machines.
GO! GO!! What are you DOING?! THROW IT!!
The screen seems to be playing back an old recording of an American football game.
The screen seems to be playing back a game of some kind, but you don't know enough about sports to tell which one.
Sorry, with you in a sec.
THROW THE GODDAMN BALL, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!
Rob, it's 3 minutes of your day. That's all we ask for every time we come by.
Yes, yes, Essie. One sec.
AHH, DAMN IT!! CAN'T YOU DO ONE GODDAMN THING RIGHT?
The core shakes his chassis.
Sorry, sorry, yeah, I'm here, I'm present.
We're here for your check-in.
Yea, that's what I figured. This the new temp?
Yes, that would be me. I'm assuming you're Rob?
At your service. I'm in charge of maintaining this here gym. If it was ever used...
Do you not get a lot of people in here?
Not really. Too busy with their fancy science to get some exercise in.

Yeah, I suppose so.
Keep it up.
Why, thank you. I try to keep it nice in case someone needs it.
I do get the occasional customer, but it's only about once a week.
So I spend my shifts watching the game instead.
Sounds fun.
You should come try out the machines some time.
I just might.
It's still important. Not much time for saving the world when you're DEAD.
I don't think a lack of exercise will kill you-
It CAN! Trust me, I've seen it happen. Like those humans in the stasis pods right now.
They're gettin' no exercise while they're sleepin'. And when they wake up? They'll wither away.
You really shouldn't get him started. He likes to rant.
Just... slowly back away.
You check off "ROB (SPORTS CORE)" from your list. That's the whole route done!
As you and Miss Esther proceed back to the offices, she congratulates you on a job well-done.
Despite all the interruptions, you made it through your whole route. And in record time, too.
Certainly an interesting cast of characters.
Yes. They tend to throw the more... eccentric cores into recreation, so they're not managing critical systems.
That makes sense.
It'll be the same thing tomorrow, same route, same check-ins.
Remember to check your e-mail for any important information. I'll send you your room number and code now.
Have a good night. Rest well.
You put in the code to your room and enter it, dropping your paperwork on the floor.
You never expected Kris to act so... sensitively. It seemed almost out-of-character.
You're glad you spent the day with Heath. She kept you entertained.
You figure you learned more about botany today than you ever did in your schooling years.
CC's conversations can get very deep. It gave you a lot to think about.
You're exhausted from your shift today, much more than usual. But it feels good.
You wonder if maybe you should've done something different today, or asked Miss Esther to come with you despite management's wishes.
Regardless, you need your rest for tomorrow's shift. You change out of your work attire and lay down for stasis.
You wake up at 08:00 as usual, get dressed, and head out the door.
Miss Esther greets you at the door.
Hello, Doctor!
Hello, Miss Esther.
Are you ready for another day? We're back to our regular routine!
You're awfully cheery today.
Oh yes, I suppose I am. It's Thursday, which means we're more than halfway through the week!
I'm simply excited for the weekend.
What do you even do over the weekend, anyway?
I have hobbies! I do... things!
Anyways, we'd better be on our way to Kris. Saturday will come quicker than you expect! Let's go!
You glance at the picture of Multnomah Falls on your desk and remember what CC said yesterday.
 You decide to...
You pick up the picture and tuck it in with your paperwork.
You leave the picture on the desk. Maybe another day.
You follow Miss Esther out of the office and towards the conference room.
You enter the conference room to see Kris whizzing across his management rail, back and forth, rapidly.
The screen behind him has a lot more red on it than usual.
Kris, we're here for your...
No time to talk. I'm trying to find the source.
The source of what?
Can't you read? Our stock plummeted overnight. We've had no large experiments lately, no important investments to make...
It just doesn't make sense!

I've reported it to finanical already, left a note that it may have been a mistake, or something in Testing...
I've... done everything I have to. I've done my job.
I'm not sure why I'm still panicking.
Sorry, Doctor. I am... calmer now.
Woah, Kris. Take a breath. You're the senior officer in charge of watching the stock, right?
Yes. That's why -
That's why you'll be fine. This is your whole job. You've got this.
But first you need to slow down.
Yes. Yes... you're right, Doctor. I apologize.
That's interesting. Can you solve it?
It's not my JOB to solve it. My job is to WATCH the stock, nothing more, and report to Finanical when it drops below a certain threshold.
I've already reported it.
Then you've done all you can, yes?
I... suppose I have.
Then there's no reason to panic.
Yes. Yes... you're right, Doctor. I apologize.
Get a hold of yourself, Kris. This is highly unprofessional.
Excuse me?
You're running all over the place in a panic. This job is not a high-stress one. There is no reason to panic.
Yes, but I've just never seen such -
No excuses. Pull yourself together.
I - uh...
I didn't know that... side of you existed, haha...
I don't think I need to ask if you're doing your job.
Yes, he made it clear right away that he was.
And his rambling put us behind schedule, Doctor.
Oh. Yes. Sorry.
I'll... handle this. You should be on your way.
Thank you, Kris.
You head out the door and towards the break room.
Before you can enter the break room, Heath stops you at the door.
Ohh! Doctor! Haha, you're here early.
Actually, we're right on time.
Yes, yes, but, er... I'm not ready for you quite yet.
I'm not prepared! So, you, uh, need to wait.

Why yes! Yes I am! And I'm not ready yet, haha. So...
So you need us to wait.
Yes!! Yes, yes.
Heath, we do have a tight schedule.
We don't have a lot of time to wait.
No, Doctor, we can't really afford to wait.
Not even for a short while?
No. Kris already put us behind.
Oh yes, I understand. No, you have places to be.
No show today, then, Doctor! I'm sorry!
That's unfortunate.
I think you saw enough yesterday to make up for it, hopefully!
If not, well, I'll just have to do better next time! Hahaha!
Miss Esther looks at Heath suspiciously.
We should get going, Doctor. Just mark the second box on your checklist instead of the first.
You check off the box that says "PREVENTED FROM INVESTIGATION".
This isn't going to make her look bad, is it?
It shouldn't, but I'll leave a note just in case.
Come along now.
Oh yes, I understand. You have places to be.
You seemed so interested yesterday...
We should get going, doctor. Just mark the second box on your checklist instead of the first.
You check off the box that says "PREVENTED FROM INVESTIGATION".
This isn't going to make her look bad, is it?
It shouldn't, but I'll leave a note just in case.
Come along now.
You and Miss Esther exit the break room and begin heading toward the greenhouse.
You've been around the section enough now that Miss Esther doesn't have to lead you anymore.
Doctor...
Yes?
Are you... enjoying your time here?
What do you mean?
I understand your... regular routine is a lot more extensive than maintenance.
That's true. Manufacturing is difficult.

I see. Yes, it's probably what you're used to.
And I don't have to engage with so many... er, characters, either.
Very true.
Well, that's great!
I'm glad you've found a... place for you in maintenance, even if it's for a short time.
You approach the door to the greenhouse.
I'll wait out here as usual.
Go ahead.
Doctor! Good to see you.
How's your shift been?
Pretty much the same as usual.
That's better than "absolutely horrible, thanks Aspen," haha.
Everything alright in here? Sprinklers functioning as normal?
Yes, actually.
Things are even better now that you're here!
Ahem. Sprinklers functioning normally, yes, yeah.
That's great.
You suddenly notice something a little concerning - the moss growing on Aspen is beginning to creep into their inner mechanisms.
This could be a maintenance issue.
Aspen, that moss on you...

Oh, this? It's just sphagnum moss. It shouldn't be an issue.
Don't worry. It won't get into anything critical. My core systems are sealed in case something like this were to happen.
It's all under control! Haha.
I do appreciate you showing concern, though, Doctor.
Of course.
You should probably get going, now. Miss Esther is waiting.
Yes, you're right. I'll see you tomorrow?
Yes, you'll see me.
Have a good day, Doctor.
You mark off your checklist and leave the greenhouse.
Miss Esther greets you outside the door.
Well now, checklist marked off, correct? Let's proceed.
The trip to CC's room is uneventful.
You contemplate how you're going to give your picture to him.
CC! Love, it's time for your check-in.
Ahh, Doctor. Welcome back.
I've brought something for you. After our conversation yesterday.
You have?
Yes.
He doesn't have hands to put the picture in, so instead you hold it up to his optic.
It's a picture of Multnomah Falls, in Oregon. I went there some time ago while I was visiting my family.
You brought this in... for me?
Well, yes. I figured you probably get tired of looking at the same old waterfalls, so here's a new one.
Haha... Thank you, Doctor. This means more than you think.
You're welcome, CC.
This is very sweet of you, Doctor.
Have there been any changes in your health?
Not that I'm aware of. I'm as sick as usual.
In fact, if anything, I feel worse than yesterday.

I suppose that is true, yes.
Your positive attitude is... refreshing.
I try to be positive. It's hard sometimes, though, I understand.
Quite.
Doctor, that's ridiculous. And rude.
I apologize. I just meant...
No, I understood what you meant. But you didn't have to say it aloud.
Uh... yes, ma'am.
No, Miss Esther. It's alright.
The doctor is correct. Aperture's energy is wasted on me.
I'm unsure as to why they bother.
CC, I'm afraid the Doctor and I are behind schedule. We should leave.
Yes, I understand.
I'll see you tomorrow, Doctor, yes?
Yes. You will.
Good.
You both leave CC behind and exit the room.
The gym isn't too far from CC's room, thankfully, and you make it there in no time.
Miss Esther is strangely quiet. And she was so chipper this morning...
Doc! Essie! Welcome back. I'd like ya to meet my friend here, Greg.
Oh... you're who he was talking about... haha.
Great. More disruptions.
Greg here's one-a-my best friends. He's technically not part of recreation, but who cares?
He also thinks he's one personality core even though he's actually three of 'em.
And they call me whack! Ha!
I-I-I don't know what he's talking about. I am one personality core.
Haha... who goes around... pretending to be three cores in one?
That's ridiculous! Right?

And I... should be going. I'll talk to you later, Rob!!
Haha. See. I knew you had common sense.
I was just talking to Rob about these "sports" he loves so much. Something surface humans do.
Surface humans?
Y'know, humans that live up on the surface. Some of the doctors here never leave.
Ah, I see.
Suddenly, Gregory's... "legs" wobble.
Oh! I need to, uh, go. I think I'm... malfunctioning.
That's not very nice... trench coats are stylish, okay?
And plus. Human fashion is an... interest of mine, kind of.
You wouldn't get that. You doctors... all you wear are those lab coats.
Suddenly, Gregory's... "legs" wobble.
Oh! I need to, uh, go. I think I'm... malfunctioning.
Gregory zooms away, gone as quickly as he came.
He's an interesting guy. I like him.
Reminds me of myself, in a way.
Anyway. The techs came by earlier today, fixed up that machine that was broken.
Don't know if it was you who put in the order, but thanks if so.
Oh, one second.
WHAT THE HELL IS YOUR PROBLEM? MOVE, DAVID, MOVE!
Sorry. He's a shitty receiver. Would be much better if they put him in literally any other position...
I have no idea what that means.
Neither do I.
Everything's alright in here then? Nothing else causing any problems?
Nope! Spic n' span, as per usual.
You must be pretty sore, though. Make sure you rest those muscles.
Aye aye, captain.
Sorry to interrupt, but it's almost shift-end, Doctor. We should leave.
Oh, yes. Absolutely.
You finish your checklist for the night, wave goodbye to Rob, and leave the gym.
Good shift today, Doctor. Tomorrow's Casual Friday. Wear whatever you feel is appropriate.
Just... try not to show too much skin.
Will do. Thank you, Miss Esther.
You arrive at your new quarters. They're humble, really only meant to house you while you sleep and no more.
You sigh.
What a weird first day...
You drop off your bag and lay down on your bed, which will wake you up in the morning.
You wonder if this thing actually makes sleep more efficient or not.
With that, you gently close your eyes.
You gently wake up and look at the clock. It's 07:30 on the dot.
Groaning, you get up and head towards your office.
Miss Esther isn't here yet. You organize your files while you wait.
Suddenly, there's a knock on the door.
Yes? Who is it?
I'm havin' some trouble here, can't seem to activate these here door mechanisms...
You get up and go over to the office entrance.

Well, y-yeah, but I was thinkin', y'know, you'd make an exception?
And why would I do that?
'Cuz I'm so charmin'?
And risk losing my job?
Alrigh', now, no need to get so serious on me...
Get out of here before Miss Esther comes and reprimands you.
I'm goin', I'm goin'.
You scoff and return back to your desk.
You unlock the door using the keypad, and a familiar face comes "stumbling" in.
Why hello there, pretty little thing.
What do you want?
I jus' wanted to come 'n say hi.
Oh, and also invite you out to my place after work, of course...
Haha, and why's that?
Well, s'not everyday now that a beautiful human like yourself shows their face 'round here.
I'm takin' a chance while I still got it, now.
I appreciate the gesture, but I'm very busy. I have a lot of work to get done.
Yea, yea, I know. You scientists are always busy.
The core glances around himself nervously.
Listen, I should scram 'fore that little pink core of yours shows up again.
Miss Esther, you mean?
Yeah, yeah, her. So. I'll send you a little message tonight.
Keep an eye on your inbox, yeah?
The core gives a little bow and exits the room.
If nothing else, he's certainly interesting...
You return back to your desk.
You stay quiet.
Uhhh... hello?
...
I swear I coulda heard you answer me. I know you're in there.
...
Or maybe not...
Maybe I'll try again later.
You hear the core zoom away from your door. You sigh.
You return to your desk.
Just as you sit back down, the door opens and Miss Esther comes barreling in extremely fast.
Sorry! Sorry I'm late! I got caught up in rail traffic...
She shakes her chassis.
You'd think with the increase in robots working at Aperture, they'd at least try to expand the rail system...
Regardless! Welcome back. Since we're a little behind, we should get started right away. Do you have everything you need?
Yes, I believe so.
Perfect. Come along, now.
You and Miss Esther approach the conference room, just as yesterday.
I know maintenance can be a tedious job, but don't get discouraged.
A lot of other employees in this department would kill to have a route like yours.
Especially considering the majority of personality cores aren't... great.
Why hello, and welcome back. I'm assuming your route went well yesterday if you're still here now.
I'd say so. Any changes in the stock today?
Not that I've seen, no. Ever since the new CEO took over, things have mostly been quiet.
She maintains the finance department well, then?
Yes, I'd say so. Smart one, that.

Is that so?
Why yes. I watch my spending carefully, especially after the turmoil the company recently went through.
Do you have any investments?
Of course. I'm not an idiot.
That's not what I was implying.
It's important to invest. I'm glad you see that.
What do you mean by that?
The former CEO. His reckless spending put the company deep in the gutter, from what I've been told.
I'm aware, but I don't like your tone.
Finances are not easy to manage.
The fact you think they are speaks measures about how well you truly manage your own.
We've really ought to be going, now.
I hope I'll see you tomorrow.
Miss Esther rolls her optic.
Yes, you have more to attend to.
You check Kris off your list and head out.
Heath likes to show a new "trick" every day, so don't be surprised if she tries to do one again.
Does she actually think what she does is "magic"?
I have no clue. I'm not particularly interested in... uh...
...getting to know any of them.
Why not?
"Connection"... it's just not my thing. I don't understand how you humans can do it.
You enter the stage room to find Heath already waiting for you.
Apologies for the delay yesterday, it won't happen again! I'm ready this time!
You wait with bated breath.
Now... choose a card... any card...
Well, any card that I have on me, preferably, but...

Oh. Yeah. You've got important science stuff to get to, huh?
Sorry. I just don't really like magic all too much.
That's alright.
You're doing everything you need to, yes? Keeping morale high and all that?
I think so.
Great.
Is THIS your card?
She pulls out exactly what you thought of - the three of clubs.
Wow! Yes, that's exactly it! Amazing.
Hahaha, thank you, thank you very much.
Miss Esther groans.
Is your morale improved? Your spirits lifted?
Definitely. And on top of that, I'm impressed, too.
O-Oh, really? It's nothing, honestly, haha.
Everything's alright here? Everything working fine?
Job's proceeding as normal. No complaints!
From me, or your coworkers! Haha!
Oh, um, actually, I don't have that card with me. Can you... choose again?
You check Heath off your list. Aspen is next.
I hope that disgusting core we saw yesterday doesn't make another appearance...
You and Miss Esther make your way over to the greenhouse.
She looks annoyed.

You decide to stay quiet. Eventually, you reach the greenhouse.
Go on, now.
You enter the greenhouse.
What's up, Miss Esther? Is something wrong?
Hmm? Oh, nothing, nothing. Just thinking about work.
Do you not like your job?
No, don't get me wrong, I do. It's just tedious.
I used to work in Testing, you know.
Testing?? That's, like, top-level work. Why'd they move you down here?
Budget cuts, basically. Testing isn't half the program it used to be.
Wayyy back in the early days of Aperture, from what I've heard, we used to test on olympians and astronauts and...
...y'know, the best of the best.
Then the 70's hit. And the funds started running low.
And...
Oh look, we're here. Go on in, now. I'm sure Aspen needs a check-up.
You decide not to question her further. You enter the greenhouse.
Once again, you are taken aback by the sheer number of plants in the greenhouse.
Aspen greets you happily.
Welcome back, welcome back.
Everything's still alright in here?
Yep! Pretty as a picture. No issues with my sprinkler, either.
How come I haven't seen any other humans in here?
They really only come in the evening to do their experiments.
Sometimes when I come in the next morning, plants are missing or mutated or...
...then there was that one time with the potato battery...

Yes, very busy. Thankfully, I love botany. And I love my job.
Well, you know what they say. If you love what you do, you'll never work a day in your life.
No, I didn't know that. But now I do! And I love that!
I should probably get going, now. Miss Esther's waiting.
Alrighty. Have a good day.
Children's toys?! Potato batteries are incredibly important to science, you know.
First of all... well, yes, they're good for teaching children. But on top of that!
It's a beautiful fusion of electronics and botany. Just like me.
Uh-huh.
You just don't get it. You're just like the last guy.
I should be going.
Yes. You should.
WHAT? No way! What type is she?
She's a snake plant named Bertha.
Snake plants? I think we had those a while back.
That's wonderful. How does she survive this far down? There's sunlight down in the offices?
I think they pump it in from the surface, like how they do in here.
That's amazing.
I should probably get going, now. Miss Esther's waiting.
Alrighty. Have a good day! Say hi to Bertha for me.
I will.
Haha. You're great. Better than the last guy.
What was wrong with the last guy?
He just... didn't really get it, y'know? Thought plants were stupid.
And me. He thought I was stupid, too.
That's horrible.
Tell me about it!
But you're here now, and you're so much better.
That's sweet of you.
Well... uh, ahem. You should get going. Miss Esther is waiting. Probably.
Yes. You're right.
You check Aspen off your list and exit the greenhouse.
I hope everything went well in there. We should get back on track towards CC, now.
Why is CC even alive?
What do you mean?
Sorry. Why did they make him? Or even... how?
I couldn't say. I'm not an expert on the way you humans think, but I have seen Aperture do many things over the years.
I'm still fairly sure we've got about 10,000 test subjects on ice in the basement, still.
Really? I thought that was just a myth.
You continue down the hallway towards CC. No interruptions so far...
Welcome back, Doctor. How have your rounds been?
They've been alright. Nothing crazy.
I'm glad. An easy day is a good day.
Are you still feeling... sick?
Haha. Yes.

I appreciate the offer, Doctor, but there's really nothing for me.
You could unplug me. That would kill me faster.
I'm afraid not, CC. Goes against our contract.
CC coughs harshly.
It's alright, I understand. Thank you, regardless.
Please let me know if there's anything I can do.
You check CC off your list and solemnly leave the room.
Let's go.
As you close the door to CC's room behind you, you glance around.
No sign of that strange figure from yesterday, thankfully.
Time for our last stop of the day.
It feels like this route's gone a lot quicker than yesterday's.
Yes, most likely because we haven't had any unnecessary interruptions.
The two of you head off towards the gym.
Welcome back, welcome back, doctor. Interested in a run on the treadmill today?
Maybe another time. Any visitors today?
Well, yes, actually - Dr. Pierce came in earlier today, said he had a dream he needed to exercise more? Or somethin'...
He's kind of crazy, not gonna lie.
Working in neurology will do that do a person.
I am having some trouble with my equipment, though. Rowing machine's busted.
Come to think of it, it was prolly busted yesterday and I just forgot to mention it.

Thanks. I'd do it myself, but, uh... I don't think I know how.
No issues.
Ahh, thank you. Sometimes it feels like half the machines in here are broke due to, uh, lack of use.
Rob suddenly looks at the screen above him.
AH, DAMN YOU! LOST THE BALL AGAIN?
You really like sports, don't you?
Uh, ahem, yeah. They keep me occupied.
Kinda need it with how lonely it gets in here.
Even when I do get visitors, they hardly ever talk to me...
Assholes.
Doctor, we really ought to be going.
Go on - I'll catch you later.
That's not very kind. Machines have feelings, too, y'know.
And I think I'd know! I AM one, after all.
I wasn't always a machine, though, I had limbs, once...
No he didn't. That's just a straight-up lie.
Rob, you were manufactured using melted-down turret panels and a lack of hope.
Whatever, Essie.
Rob turns to face you.
She's crazy.
Ugh. Let's go, Doctor.
You check Rob off your list once more to finish the day off.
As you leave the gym, Miss Esther turns to you as you begin walking back to your office.
Tomorrow's agenda will be slightly different, so just be prepared for a switch in the routine.
A switch in the routine? It's only the second day.
Yes, but even temps have to follow the maintenance schedule.
How will it be "different"?
I'll let you know tomorrow. For now, get some rest.
You make your way to your quarters. After organizing your paperwork, you lay down in your bed.
Before you fall asleep, you wonder what Miss Esther meant by tomorrow being "different".
You wake up, slowly but surely, and turn to the clock. 08:00, again.
Work in manufacturing doesn't begin until 11, and it's going to take a bit to get used to this new schedule.
You get up and go towards your office.
Miss Esther is here on time today, and greets you happily.
Hello, Doctor!
Hello, Miss Esther.
Today's agenda is very simple.
Once a week, the maintenance employee must spend one full shift with a core under their section, to ensure that work is actually getting done.
After all, they could just pretend to do their job when you come in, and completely ignore their responsibilities otherwise.
The core that gets overseen changes every week, so it keeps them on alert, so to speak.
I see. Makes sense.
In addition, I am not permitted to accompany you today. They'd like to see if you can handle the position without my supervision.
Miss Esther laughs.
I think that's ridiculous. Of course you can. I don't see why I shouldn't accompany you, but...
Policy, I suppose.
Anyway! Which core are you interested in overseeing today?


Ugh, that thing?
Unfortunately, I have no idea who he even is, much less what his job is.
I don't even know if he's a core in our section.
I have nothing in my database to allow you to oversee... that thing, so, no. Choose again.
Okay, then...
I'm afraid that Gregory isn't under our supervision. He's technically a Section C7 core, which puts him out of our scope of work.
I'm not even sure what his responsibilities are.
You'll have to pick somebody else.
Alright, then...
Really? That egotistic idiot?
I suppose it doesn't matter who you pick, as long as I can log it properly.
I'll put it in my database that you'll be supervising Kris today. Do you remember the way to the conference room?
Yes, I do.
Perfect. You should be on your way, then.
You enter the conference room to see Kris staring at the screen. You can't understand what's happening, but that's his job, not yours.
Kris?
Kris turns to face you, smug as ever.
Well, well. Miss Esther sent me a notification that you'd be overseeing my work today.
Yes, that's right.
Couldn't get enough of my charm, hmm?
Haha, very funny.
Be prepared for a long and boring shift. Watching a screen all day isn't all it's made out to be.

Me? Exciting? Well now. I try not to be too exciting.
Especially after the disaster that was our former management.
What was wrong with the former management?
Oh, that's right. Miss Esther did say you were a... newer employee.
You must not have been here when Mr. Johnson was still at the head of the company.
No, I wasn't. I was part of the first new hire wave about 9 months ago. But I've heard... stories about him.
Mr. Johnson was an... interesting man. You might hear some... lesser cores refer to him by his first name, "Cave".
I still have some semblance of respect for the man, regardless of his ridiculous financial policies.
He just... did not handle the company very well in terms of our monetary investments.
Were you working during the time?
In a way, yes. I was activated in 1979, but I was originally a consultant. As Mr. Johnson lost more and more employees due to mandatory testing, he began replacing them with... us.
That's why there's so many personality cores around now. We're... remnants.
The man never stopped spending Aperture's money. And it led him to his death.
You seem bitter about it, still.
Hmm. I suppose I am. I enjoyed my consulting work. After Miss Caroline took over as CEO, a lot of things happened.
Projects got shut down. Employees were fired. Personality cores became... less important.
The scene fades to Kris looking down solemnly.
I'm stubborn for that reason.
My job is... simple. Perhaps not every personality core can read a stock market graph, but... it's a useless job.
I think what you do is very important.
Not as important as it should be. Miss Caroline, she...
She doesn't trust us. And I'm not sure why.
She is excellent at what she does. She's dragged Aperture out of the ditch it was in, but...
The company now... it's different. Mr. Johnson was fascinated with us. Miss Caroline is not.
The screen fades back to normal.
But that's neither here nor there. I'm satisfied enough with the work I do, regardless of how inconsequential it is.
I see.
The rest of your shift is uneventful. Kris does his job well enough for your audit on him to pass.
He flirts with you a little. You feel your face flush.
When your shift is over, you wish it wasn't.
Ahh, it's 16:00. That's your clock-out time, correct?
Yes. I suppose it is.
Unfortunate. I enjoyed our time today.
Me too.
I'll see you tomorrow, yes?
Yes. You will.
You finish your checklist, and leave the conference room to head back to your office.
I see. Well then, I hope you brought some entertainment.
Kris turns back to the screen.
Though you try to make conversation with him to pass the time, he either ignores you or brushes you off.
Perhaps you shouldn't have dismissed him so easily.
The time ticks by incredibly slowly, and the graph doesn't change enough to entertain you.
Eventually, it's 16:00, and it's time for you to go.
You finish your checklist and leave the conference room without a word.
Well, if anything, at least you'll be entertained.
Truly, it doesn't matter who you pick, as long as they're in my systems.
I'll put it in my database that you'll be supervising Heath today. Do you remember the way to the break room?
Yes, I do.
Perfect. On your way, then.
You enter the empty break room cautiously. Heath is nowhere to be seen.
Heath? I'm here.
You hear her voice from behind the curtain.
Uh... yes, yes!! One minute, please. You got here faster than I thought...
The crashing and rattling taking place doesn't ease your conscience.
Suddenly, Heath whirls out with a puff of smoke, coughing.
Ahem. Uh. Sorry, I've been trying to get my next big performance ready.
It's not going so great.
But anyways! Welcome back! Good to see you.
Miss Esther told me you chose ME, of all cores, to oversee today.
Yes, that's right.
Well, you're in for a treat. My whole job is entertainment, so I'll be sure to keep you awake and aware!
Don't be surprised if I sweep you off your feet!

Oh, haha, that's not what I... expected you to say...
But I'd be thrilled to oblige!! Prepare for the show of your lifetime!
Heath goes back behind her curtain and begins mumbling to herself. Bowling pins and an 8-ball roll out.
You have no idea how she does magic without hands.
Heath?
Yes?
What's behind that curtain of yours, anyway?
Oh! Would you like to see?
Uhhh... sure, why not?
Heath parts the curtains.
You're stunned by what you see -
 - a hidden-away, wooden room, lined with fairy lights, shelves stocked with magic paraphenalia.
Tada!! This is my magic room. It's where I keep all the stuff I use to perform my tricks.
Wow, Heath. I can't believe this. It's amazing.
Yes, yes, I know.
There's my magic 8 ball, my stuffed rabbit, my bowling pins - for juggling.
You can juggle?
Hahaha, no. But you could!
I haven't shown anyone else this room, so you should consider yourself lucky!
Heath comes back out and closes the curtains.
Oh, just some miscellaneous props and such. Nothing too special.
Heath comes back out of the curtains. You try to get a peek at what's behind them, but it's no use.
The rest of the day is exciting. Heath keeps you entertained with plenty of tricks, all which leave you bewildered.
She somehow manages to pull off some of these better than the human magicians you know.
An occasional coworker comes into the break room and watches her, too. They don't seem as into it as they should be, you think.
You find her inspiring.
But every show must come to an end, and once hers does, you find yourself disappointed.
Thank you, Heath. This was great. I had an amazing time today watching you perform.
Thank you, thank you, Doctor. You're the most captive audience I've had in ages!
She gives you a bow as you finish your checklist and head back to your office.
I really haven't impressed you at all??
I don't even have hands! You're not impressed by that?
I don't know. I've seen crazier stuff happen at Aperture.
Oh.
The shift isn't very fun, after that. Heath tends to keep to herself.
The occasional coworker comes in, and she'll put on a show for them - but generally doesn't speak to you otherwise.
You think you offended her.
The time ticks by incredibly slowly.
Eventually, it's 16:00, and it's time for you to go.
You finish your checklist and leave.
Good choice. They're a nice kid.
I'm sure they'll appreciate the company.
I'll put it in my database that you'll be supervising Aspen today. Do you remember the way to the greenhouse?
Yes, I do.
Good. Off you go!
You enter the greenhouse. Aspen is humming quietly while they water the plants.
Aspen?
They jump and spin around rapidly.
Holy Aperture!! You scared me.
Sorry, sorry. Didn't mean to.
You're here early...
Oh! Today's the one-on-one observation day!
Yes, now I see the message Miss Esther sent me about you overseeing me today...
Sorry. I can get a little "in-the-zone" so to speak, when I'm working.
You're alright.
So wait, why'd you choose to supervise me? All I do is water plants all day.
I don't think the last guy ever chose me on his Wednesdays...

Oh! Well then, I'm happy to oblige. What are you interested in?
How many of you are in Botany?
Let me think...
I believe there's a total of 70 of us? Uh... the researchers, scientists... gardeners like me.
That's not a lot.
You're right - it's really not!
I kind of like it though. It keeps us accountable. If even one of us falters, the whole team will suffer.
That's a lot of pressure.
Tell me about it.
So, uh... do you have a favorite plant? Out of all of these?
Oh yes! Absolutely! Come over here, and I'll show you.
You follow Aspen on their management rail as they lead you to a back corner.
The screen fades to a close-up shot of Aspen looking down at a fern. The scene is softly lit and is mostly dark.
This is Penelope. She's an "Adiantum" - a maidenhair fern.
She's extremely tempermental. Doesn't listen to anyone but me.
I swear, if any other greenhouse employee tries to water her or test on her, she'll throw a fit.
Haha, not literally, of course. She'll just wilt. But she's my favourite.
She's beautiful.
Thank you. I know.
You suddenly realize how close you are to Aspen. They realize, too.
Oh! Uh, sorry. I'm just excited to show you my... favorite plant.
No worries.
Oh, not really. I like all my plants equally.
Can't be picking favorites - what if one dies? Hah.
The rest of your shift is very informative.
Aspen spends their time watering the plants and rattling off botanical facts.
You learn more about botany than you ever thought you'd care to.
They seem to love their job.
You're happy for them.
Before you know it, it's 16:00 and time to go home.
You finish off your checklist and head out.
Oh... yeah. I suppose. All I do is water plants, after all.
The rest of your shift is easy, yes, but boring.
You spend most of your time sitting there while Aspen focuses whole-heartedly on their job.
You have no idea what to say to them.
Perhaps you shouldn't have been so harsh.
The time ticks by incredibly slowly. Eventually, it's 16:00, and it's time for you to go.
You finish your checklist and leave.
Yes. As long as they're along our usual route, yes.
I'm sure he'll appreciate the company.
I'll put it in my database that you'll be supervising CC today. Do you remember the way to his room?
Yes, I do.
Perfect. On your way, then!
You make your way into CC's "hospital" room. He is hanging in the same spot.
You believe he may be sleeping. Or something similar.
You gently poke his chassis.
CC?
Ahh, Doctor. Apologies, I was... trying to conserve my energy.
You need to conserve energy?
What're all these tubes and pumps for, then?
A multitude of things. A lot of them I'm not even sure of.
Oh, sorry - I just got a message from Miss Esther...
Oh.
Haha... you chose to supervise me today?
Well then...
You're going to be very bored.

I... interest you?
Haha. That's silly.
But it's...
...more than the last doctor said.
You know, you woke me up from my dream.
You can dream?
In a way, I suppose. Cores don't quite... "dream" the same way humans do, but... yes. We can visualize things.
What were you... visualizing... about?
The scene fades to CC looking down solemnly. He's back-lit by his window. In the foreground, you can see the computers that monitor his health.
Well... it's a little embarrassing.
See, I have so many bio-simulators and pain receptors stuffed into my chassis, it's like I'm practically organic.
And I've heard the scientists talk about these wondrous things called "waterfalls"...
They must be beautiful. Water falling so freely, no... tubes to tether it down, management rails to confine it...
I think about it a lot.
I would give anything to see one.
But I know I never will. So I look at pictures. And it's almost the same.
Nothing, really. Just wishing I was healthy.
I always dream about that.
The rest of the day is quiet, slow, but nice.
CC is more full of life than ever.
He talks about his daily routine. Asks you plenty of questions about your own life.
Your shift goes by quickly, and when it ends, you find you don't want to leave.
But 16:00 comes as always.
I need to get going, CC. But... this was nice. Relaxing.
Especially after the weirdly chaotic week I've had.
Yes. I understand. I'm glad I could give you a... break, sort of.
You finish your checklist and head out for the day.
Well, I guess we can both preserve our energy, then.
The rest of your shift is boring.
CC won't wake up no matter what you do, and it's nearly impossible to fall asleep in the hard chair you're in.
You end up trying to read the manual next to him, but it's full of technical jargon.
Even with all your experience in manufacturing, some of these terms still don't ring any bells.
Eventually, just as you're about to drift off, the clock hits 16:00, and it's time to go home.
You finish your checklist and quietly leave the room.
You want to supervise him? Well, don't let me stop you.
I'll put it in my database that you'll be supervising Robert today. Do you remember the way to the gym?
Yes, but - sorry, Robert?
His full name. He prefers to go by Rob, though, so... don't tell him I told you.
GO! GO! GO!!! COME ON, PUT YOUR BACK INTO IT!
You enter the gym and immediately spot Rob yelling at the screen in front of him.
CAN'T RUN TO SAVE YOUR GODDAMN LIFE! COME ON!!
Um... Rob?
Sorry, Doc. One second. The game's on.
He turns back to the screen just in time for -
TOUCHDOWN!! HELL YEAH!
The crowd on the screen goes wild, yelling and shouting. You forgot how big American football used to be.
The crowd on the screen goes wild, yelling and shouting. You assume this is a good thing, because Rob looks pleased.
Sorry, sorry, Doc. The game gets me excited. You should know this by now.
No worries.
I saw the message from Essie. You chose to supervise me today, huh?
Yes, that's right.
Well, that's perfect. Great time to get those muscles to work, now!

I'm surprised you even know the name of one of the machines.
Most of the doctors here don't care.
I do try to keep in shape a little bit, when I can. Usually on the weekends.
Well alright then! Elliptical's right over there. Feel free to use any of the machines.
Need a coach?
Sure. Why not?
Rob moves on his management rail over to the elliptical machine.
The scene fades to Rob looking down at you, "HANG IN THERE!" poster and TV screen behind him.
Alright, hop on, let's get started.
You begin your workout, and Rob coaches you on your form.
You're too tight. Loosen up.
How do you know so much about fitness without... well... having limbs?
Well, it's partially 'cuz it's programmed into me.
I'm also just real passionate about humans in general. Fitness is just the one aspect I really enjoy.
Interesting.
You're going too slow, now. You need to pick up the pace.
I'm... trying.
Don't overwork yourself.
Thanks, Rob. I will.
The rest of your shift is hard work!
You spend most of your time trying out the different machines. Though you try to keep fit, it's hard with a job like this.
It's nice to actually focus on a workout for once.
In between yelling at the screen, Rob talks about his day-to-day.
He talks about his ex-wife and two kids - you don't bother to ask how that's even possible.
At the end of the day, you're sweating and tired, but satisfied.
No doubt you'll be sore tomorrow, though.
Rob looks pleased with you.
Great job. Great workout. Hope you got something out of it.
Oh, I definitely did. Haha.
You tiredly finish your checklist and head out.
You don't work out?! Why the hell are you here then?
I figured I could just watch the game you're always looking at.
Nuh-uh. That won't do.
You are a DISGRACE to the nature of the game!
Get your head in it!
Uh... what?
Nevermind. Just sit down.
The rest of your shift is pretty entertaining, at least.
Rob refuses to acknowledge you, but his outbursts at the screen keep you awake.
The time goes by quickly enough, even though you feel judged the entire time.
16:00 comes around, and it's time to head out.
You finish your checklist and go back to the office.
Welcome back, Doctor! How did your shift go?
It went great. The shift was easy and went by quickly.
That's great to hear. I'll take the data you collected and you can head out for the night.
Like I said, it's a simple shift!
You hand your clipboard over Miss Esther. What an interesting day...
It was okay. Nothing happened, really.
Sometimes that's a good thing. Inaction is better than a bad reaction, after all.
I'll take your data for the day and you can head out for the night.
You hand your clipboard over to Miss Esther.
You enter back into your room.
You weren't out for very long - the clock reads 12:35.
You think back to Miss Esther's warning.
That was strangely out-of-character for her...
You shrug it off, for now.
You have to prepare your paperwork for tomorrow.
Before you know it, your eyes are getting heavy.
For a job with not a lot to do, there sure are a lot of emails to respond to...
You take a breath, mentally prepare yourself to start work again tomorrow, and lay down in your bed.
You wake up at 07:30. It's not so bad this time.
Seems your body is getting used to the new sleep schedule - something it'll regret when you go back to work in Manufacturing.
You sigh, change, grab your paperwork, and head out the door.
You arrive just before shift-start. Miss Esther is waiting for you.
Doctor! It's a brand-new day. A brand-new week, even.
Excited to get to work?
I guess you could say I am.
She seems unconcerned. Perhaps the warning she gave you yesterday was nothing to worry about, after all...
Excellent. Grab your paperwork - Kris is first, as usual.
You enter into the conference room. It seems everything is back to normal.
The screen is lit up once more, and Kris is back to watching it.
Miss Esther sighs. You can't tell if it's out of annoyance or relief.
Happy Monday, Kris.
Annoyance. It's probably annoyance.
Doctor. Good to see you. Welcome back.
Couldn't get enough of me, even after this weekend, hm?
Miss Esther looks at him suspiciously, but says nothing.
As you can most likely tell, things are back to normal for me.
Something I'm... very grateful for.
It seems that way, yes.
Miss Esther, you're... in high spirits today.
I suppose I am. Not entirely sure why, but...
...take what you can get, Kris.
Oh, do not worry. I will.

Yes... I did not appreciate the glitch last week that caused my panic.
I spoke to Financial about it and they assured me that it shouldn't happen again, but...
I doubt their truthfulness.
Why's that?
They've lied to me in the past. Perhaps they see me as a shell of my former glory?
They forget who I used to be.
Regardless. I do not mean to be bitter, Doctor. Forgive me.
You help to... brighten my outlook, despite my pessimism.
Doctor, you should -
Ah, yes, Miss Esther. Finish my checklist and leave.
Why... yes. Exactly that.
Go on, Doctor. As always, it was a pleasure to have you.
I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.
Thank you, Kris.
You finish your checklist and leave the conference room.
As am I. I may not be... entirely content with what I do, but...
I feel quite... useless when I am not working.
Especially considering this is my sole purpose.
Ah, yeah. I understand.
I knew you would.
But, uh... yes. Everything is back to normal. Perfect, even. Now that you're here.
Kris... watch yourself.
Ah. Yes ma'am.
You're sweet, Kris. I should be going, though.
Mmm. No worries. Thank you for your concern.
Have an excellent day, Doctor.
Thank you.
You finish your checklist and leave the conference room.
Doctor. There you are. I was worried you'd be late again.
You'll be well aware when we're late, Kris.
And Miss Esther. Good morning to you.
I see your screen is back to being online.
Excellent powers of observation. Yes, Financial re-activated my screen.
I'm assuming everything's back to normal, then?
Yes. There are some aspects of my routine I enjoy...
He looks you up and down.
Others... not so much.
Now, Kris. Don't be rude.
Mmm. Forgive me.
I'm glad to see everything's alright in here, now.
Mhm.
I'll... uh, be going.
Yes. Thank you.
You finish your checklist and leave the conference room.
The short trip from the conference room to the break room is once again uneventful.
You enter into the breakroom to find a frightening sight.
Oh my - Heath, are you alright?!
Uh...
Kind of?
Heath is pinned to the wall of the stage by 4 different knives.
How did you even -
I-I'm honestly not sure, Doctor, I...
....I GOT YOU!
She suddenly whirls out of in-between the knives in an impressive feat of dexterity.
You thought I was actually stuck?
The GREAT AND AMAZING Heath would NEVER find herself in a predicament she couldn't escape from...
Lowly knives cannot contain me!
Not really magic, but...
So... what did you think, Doctor?
Yet another amazing trick by yours truly...
O-Or, not yours, uhh...

Hahaha! I'm so glad, Doctor.
And Miss Esther? You seemed so worried!
Yes. Worried I'd be stuck with even more paperwork tonight...
She's so harsh.
Everything's working fine in here, Heath?
Oh, yes. No complaints!
Although... when you stop by the gym today, could you ask Rob to turn his TV down?
It keeps breaking my concentration! I'm trying to plan my next show, and...
It sometimes surprises me how thin these walls are...
...although it is pretty much just management rails back there. And empty space.
So I guess it's not that surprising.
Yes, I'll make sure to tell him.
Great! Thank you, Doctor.
Now. You should be going.
Miss Esther's glaring at me. Haha!
You check the box off on your clipboard and leave the break room.
As am I! Haha.
Don't worry, Doctor. I'm well aware of what I can and can't do!
Plus, who would've thrown the knives at me, anyway?
You have a point.
I appreciate the concern, though.
I find I don't really take my... "safety" into consideration when I come up with my tricks.
Oh, that much is obvious, Heath.
But I got you both because of it!
Everything's working fine in here?
Oh, yes. No complaints!
Although... when you stop by the gym today, could you ask Rob to turn his TV down?
It keeps breaking my concentration! I'm trying to plan my next show, and...
It sometimes surprises me how thin these walls are...
...although it is pretty much just management rails back there. And empty space.
So I guess it's not that surprising.
Yes, I'll make sure to tell him.
Great! Thank you, Doctor.
Now. You should be going.
Miss Esther's glaring at me. Haha!
You check the box off on your clipboard and leave the break room.
Haha... ridiculous. Me, getting stuck!
I can't believe I finally got you, Miss Esther!
Don't oversell yourself, now.
Well then, Doctor. Come to check in on me as per usual?
Yes, that's right.
As you can see, everything's in ship-shape. Me, my equipment, my impeccable skill...
So there's no need for concern!
That's good.
Although... when you stop by the gym today, could you ask Rob to turn his TV down?
It keeps breaking my concentration! I'm trying to plan my next show, and...
It sometimes surprises me how thin these walls are...
...although it is pretty much just management rails back there. And empty space.
Yes, I'll take care of it.
You should be on your way now - you've got more cores to check in on, after all!
Ah, yes. You're right.
Thank you, Heath.
You check another box off your paperwork and leave the break room.
You begin heading upstairs towards the greenhouse.
Miss Esther follows close behind.
I couldn't help but notice that you don't seem to... get along with many other cores here.
Yes, I suppose you're right.
Honestly, I'm not sure why...
I like Aspen. They're a good kid - incredibly kind to everyone they meet.
And I feel for CC. His plight is an... indicator of how Aperture treats us.
But I'm not sure why I can't seem to... connect with any of the others.
It was the same while I was in Testing. The scientists would have favorite test subjects or coworkers or supervisors...
But for me, they were all the same.
I was there to do my job, not much else.
It's honestly only after starting this job that I began to truly... feel for others, in some aspects.
They used to call me the "Sociopath Core" while I worked in Testing... as a joke, of course.
But I - wait a minute...
Doctor! Miss Esther! Good to see you.
Gregory? What are you doing here?
I'm just on my way to the lounge - finished my work up top, so I'm headed down for a quick drink.
What do you do in your section, anyway?
Oh! Uhh...
Well, C7 is mostly for meetings and visits from shareholders...
I'm an event coordinator! Kind of. I make sure that the meeting rooms are set up and all the tech's working fine.
Then I leave before the important business people see me! Haha.

Aha, yes, it is, uh... thanks.
I didn't have many meetings to set up today, so I got to clock out early.
But hey! I got to run into you because of it, so, uh...
I'm glad.
Now, Miss Esther is starting to scare me with that glare of hers, so...
...I gotta run!
I'll see you later, Doctor!
And he's off.
They're certainly interesting, though the slightest bit annoying...
W-Well, yes, but it's not as easy as it sounds...
Every shareholder wants something different, and every manager likes a different setup...
Not only is it my job to get things ready, but it's also my job to remember everyone's preferences.
Thank goodness I have thrice the processing power of a -
Oh, I mean... uh...
Ahem. I work thrice as fast as -
Y'know what? Nevermind. I've gotta go!
And he's off.
They're certainly interesting, though the slightest bit annoying...
The two of you finally approach the greenhouse doors.
Go on now, Doctor. I'll be waiting for you.
You enter the greenhouse once more. Nothing seems out of the ordinary.
Aspen is turned away from you, watering in the back left corner.
Aspen?
They turn around.
Doctor! Come over here, please.
You walk over to the back corner and stand next to them.
Check it out - chrysanthemums!
Chrysanthemum × morifolium. Or, y'know, just... chrysanthemums. Florist's daisy.
Oh my.
They're testing micropropogation on them right now... thankfully, a pretty harmless procedure.
So they're doing really good at the moment.
They should have bloomed earlier, but things get weird underground.
I'm not sure how half of them still bloom at the right time of year anymore.
Regardless - aren't they beautiful?

O-Oh, I... um, uh...
Ahem. Uh...
Thank you, Doctor, I uh...
Don't know what to say to that.
You're... quite beautiful yourself.
Anyways! Um, everything's working fine in here right now.
Sprinkler isn't malfunctioning at all? Moss staying far away from your internal mechanisms?
Yep! All of that!
So you should, uh... get going. I think I need to...
...go dunk myself in the aqueduct.
You laugh and leave the greenhouse behind.
Anyways, that's what I wanted to show you. They just bloomed yesterday!
Everything else is working fine. Nothing to report, no concerns.
It seems most of the specimens have recovered from that brief power loss a few days ago, so that's good!
Glad to hear.
Anyways, you should probably be on your way, Doctor. Miss Esther is waiting for you.
Ah, yes. I'll be going now.
See you tomorrow!
You say your goodbyes to Aspen and leave the greenhouse behind.
Oh, Doctor. Welcome back.
Here for my check-in, right?
Yes, that's correct.
Well, everything's proceeding as normal. I don't have any complaints.
We are in a delicate testing cycle right now though, so... if you could limit your time here, that would be great.
I just need to make sure you're not malfunctioning in any way.
When I started, I was told your sprinkler can cause issues, so...
I did already say I didn't have any complaints, Doctor.
If there was something wrong with my sprinkler I would have said it then.
Ah. Yes.
Uh... thank you, Aspen. I'll be going now.
Thank you, Doctor. I'll see you tomorrow.
You shake your head and leave the greenhouse behind.
Miss Esther is waiting for you outside.
Hello again, Doctor. Hope everything went well in there!
Let's be on our way back down to CC, now.
I swear...
Sometimes it feels like the trip from the main section to this upper part takes up half our shift...
You don't run into anyone on your way to CC's room.
Miss Esther seems very happy about that.
Here we are now. No noises inside the room today...
Let's go in.
You enter into CC's room. He's staring out the window beside him.
You don't know what he's looking at, considering all you can see outside it is a blank white void.
Good afternoon, CC. How has your day been?
Good, all things considered.
The usual.
If you were worried I was getting better, Miss Esther...
No need to anymore. I feel worse than ever.
Oh, CC...
Oh, and Doctor. Good to see you again.
I hope you do not find my pessimism off-putting.
As you're well aware, it's difficult to be positive sometimes.
I know. I understand.
Seeing your face always brightens my day, though.
Is there anything you need? Anything I can help with?
Not that I can think of, no. I always appreciate your concern, though.
You make me feel like I'm not just an experiment anymore.

I... oh.
Doctor, you're... too kind to me, haha.
Thank you.
You... should be going, now. More check-ins to do, yes?
Thank you, CC.
Doctor... please come and see me tomorrow.
I will.
You check CC off your list and leave the room with Miss Esther.
Haha. Thank you, Doctor.
Even if you're only here for one more week, I will remember your kindness.
You should go, now. I think I need rest.
Yes. Of course. Have a good day, CC.
Thank you.
You check CC off your list and leave the room with Miss Esther.
Oh... Doctor. My apologies, I didn't see you there.
I'm assuming you two have come for my check-up.
Yes, that's correct.
Well, as I just mentioned, I'm still sick. Very much so.
No matter how much I rest, it doesn't get any better...
Of course, I know it won't, but...
I'm sorry, CC.
It's alright, Miss Esther. But you two should be going. I'm sure you have more to attend to.
Yes. Thank you, CC.
You check CC off your list and leave the room with Miss Esther.
Miss Esther is quiet on the way to the gym.
Her mood seems to flip on a dime - incredibly happy and energetic at one point, solemn and quiet the next.
It makes her hard to read.
You approach the gym door without any interruptions.
Doc! Essie! How's it hanging?
Good to see you both alive.
Why wouldn't we be alive?
Ah, you never know what could happen, yeah?
Can't ever be too careful!
Nice to see you again, Rob. Everything's alright in here?
Yep! All good, as per -
ARE YOU KIDDING ME? WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?! DUMBASS!!
...as per usual, yeah.
I really wish you'd stop yelling so much, Rob.
Agh, sorry, Essie.
And stop calling me Essie. That's Miss Esther to you.
Habits! What can ya do, yeah?
Anyway, Doc, it's all good.
Oh - Heath asked me to tell you to turn your TV down.
She can hear it from all the way over there?
Yikes. She must hate me, haha.
Ah, I gotcha. I'll turn it down. My bad.

'Course, Doc.
Now you should prolly -
GO! GO!! COME ON! WHAT THE HELL, JACOB?
- get goin'. S'almost four, yeah?
Ah yeah, you're right. Thanks again, Rob.
Yeah, s'no problem. See ya tomorrow!
You finish off your checklist and head back towards the office.
Ah, uh, thank you, Doc. Kind of you to say that.
Even though I ain't really a man at all, but...
I'm pickin' up what you're puttin' down.
Eugh.
Now you should prolly -
GO! GO!! COME ON! WHAT THE HELL, JACOB?
- get goin'. S'almost four, yeah?
Ah yeah, you're right. Thanks again, Rob.
Anytime, Doc. Always willing to do ya some good.
If there's anything else I can do for you...
...you just let me know.
Will do.
See ya tomorrow!
You finish off your checklist and head back towards the office.
Essie! And you brought the Doc with you.
Just here for the regular routine checkup.
Ah, yeah. Why else would you be here?
Not like you care 'bout ol' Rob, anyhow.
Now, Rob, let's be professional, here.
Kinda hard when I'm not treated with respect, Essie.
To be entirely fair, you don't show me much respect, either.
Got me there.
Anyway. Everything's runnin' fine, so you don't gotta put any little notes on your clipboard there.
Oh - Heath did ask me to tell you to turn your TV down.
She can hear it from all the way over there?
Yikes. She must hate me, haha. That makes two of ya, I suppose.
I'll turn it down. She's got nothing to worry about.
Thank you.
Alrigh', now, you should get goin'. I don't wanna miss any of my game for this.
We'll be leaving.
And with that, you finish off your checklist and head back to your office.
Well! Uneventful day, all things considered.
That's the way I like it! Haha.
Now - expect the normal routine. You should check your email before heading to bed.
Thank you for your work today, Doctor. I will see you tomorrow.
You enter your chambers once more.
Well... Kris certainly gave me a run for my money today... haha!
I wonder where Heath got that dove from... haha.
You place the cactus Aspen gave you, [cactusname], beside your "bed".
The flowers look as bright as ever.
I never expected CC to recite poetry to me...
You place your Topps baseball card by your "bed".
It's honestly a little shocking he would give this to me... haha.
A fairly... normal day, all things considered.
Throwing your paperwork down for the day, you sigh.
You lay down in your bed for the night.
You wake up at 7:30, more ready for the day than ever.
Only two more days...
You grab your paperwork, get dressed, and leave your chambers.
You enter your office.
Miss Esther isn't here yet.
Strange...
The last time she was late was my second day here.
You sit down at your desk and organize while you wait.
Eventually, it's 08:30, and she still hasn't shown.
Where is she?
You decide to wait a little longer.
The clock now reads 09:00. No sign of your supervisor.
Uh...
I suppose I should just... get to work?
You gather your materials, compose yourself, and head towards Kris.
You enter Kris' room without Miss Esther behind you. It still feels a little strange.
Doctor? You're late.
Where's Miss Esther?
No clue. That's why I'm behind - she never showed up today.
Strange... that woman is exceedingly punctual.
It's not like her to be late...
Anyhow. Things are proceeding as normal here.
And you look amazing today, Doctor. As usual.
Thank you. You don't look too bad yourself.
Don't flatter me too much, now, or people might start to think...
He sighs.
As much as I'd love for you to stay and... waste time with me...
...you're very far behind on schedule.
Yes, I know.
Miss Esther may not be here to usher you along, but you must stay disciplined.
You do have paperwork to turn in still, after all.
You're right.
Plus... I'm sure we'll have plenty of time this weekend.
Go on now! Have a wonderful day, Doctor.
You too, Kris.
I always have a good day after seeing you.
You finish checking Kris off your list and leave the room.
You only have two more days left until you go back to Manufacturing.
Are you looking forward to it?
I'm not sure.
Fair enough.
Change is difficult.
I'm curious who the permanent employee for this position might be...
If they're anything like you, I'll be happy. All I ask is for someone kind.
Now. As much as I'd love to have you stay and chat, you're very far behind on schedule.
Yes, I know.
Miss Esther may not be here to usher you along, but you must stay disciplined.
You do have paperwork to turn in still, after all.
You're right.
Go on now! Have a wonderful day, Doctor.
You too, Kris.
I will.
You finish checking Kris off your list and leave the room.
Not like you care all that much. Simply here to do a job, after all.
Not to be hostile or anything, but you do distract my focus when you're here, Doctor.
Sorry.
Don't be sorry. Can't control it. What can you do?
You only have two more days left until you go back to Manufacturing.
I'm curious who the permanent employee for this position might be...
If they're anything like you, I'll be incredibly disappointed.
Now. I'd love for you to stay and chat, but you are behind schedule. You should be on your way.
Yes. Thank you, Kris.
You finish checking Kris off your list and leave the room.
You enter Heath's break room once again.
Welcome, Doctor! Prepare for an interesting trick...
...wait, where's Miss Esther?
I'm not sure. She never showed up.
Weird...
There's a metal bucket hanging from her handle.
What's the bucket for?
Patience, patience! All shall be revealed.
First though - look inside the bucket. It's empty, correct?
You do so. There's nothing in there.
Yes, it's empty.
As soon as you step back, you hear a metal clank sound, and the bucket shifts slightly.
Are you so sure?
You look inside the bucket - there's an Aperture credit in there.
What... how did you do that?
Magic!
...and...
You hear another clank, though gentler, and she shows you the bucket again.
The credit is gone.
...a little bit of showmanship! Haha!
She tosses the bucket to the side with flair.
Now... for the final part of the trick...
Check your left pocket!
You check. There's a credit in it.
Oh my god.
Keep it, Doc! A little gift from me.
There's plenty more where that came from!
She looks at you happily.
That was incredible, Heath. Just like you.
Why thank you, Doctor. You aren't too bad yourself! Haha.
S-Sorry. I'm still a little nervous after yesterday!
And Miss Esther's not here to balance the mood out.
You're alright. It's cute.
I know I am!
I wish you could stay, Doctor, I really do. I love your company, but...
From the look of the clock, you're really behind schedule! And my trick today took up a lot of time, haha.
Oh - yes, I should probably get going.
Don't worry - I'll see you this weekend, right?
I hope so.
Wonderful. Have an excellent day, Doctor!
I always do after seeing you.
You check Heath off your list and leave the break room.
What'd you think of that trick, Doc?
Impressive. I don't know how you did it.
Difficult without hands, but I make it work!
Imagine if I did have hands! I'd be the best magician ever!
I do find it interesting that Miss Esther didn't show...
She's usually very tough on herself.
Yeah, I'm not sure. I just decided I should probably get my job done.
Speaking of! Looking at the clock, you're far behind schedule - you should probably go!
Sorry for taking up so much time!
You're alright, Heath, no worries.
Have a great day, Doctor. I'll see you tomorrow?
Yes.
You check Heath off your list and leave the break room.
Who knows? Maybe it'll help you be a little more positive!
What does that mean?
Oh, nothing, haha.
I do find it interesting that Miss Esther didn't show...
She's usually very tough on herself.
Yeah...
Anyways! My trick took a lot of time today, and you're behind.
You should get going!
Oh. Yes. I will.
Thank you, Heath.
You check Heath off your list and leave the break room.
Suddenly, you hear a familiar sound - weighed-down wheels.
Gregory comes around the corner and nearly runs into you.
Doctor! O-Oh. Hi!
Gregory? What are you doing down here?
I was just on my way to see Kris - there's a... a meeting in his conference room. They ran out of space upstairs.
So I have to go get it ready.
But...
Actually, now that you're here, there's... uh... something I need to tell you, Doc -
Me? Specifically?
Yeah! You! Uh...
It might be a little strange...
A-And you might think of me differently afterwards, but...
This is important. To me. To... us.
We've been thinking it over, and we have to do this.
Us? We?
Gregory moves his bottom handle slightly, unbuttoning his trench coat. It falls to the ground.
What stands before you is not a personality core - but three of them, just as you thought.
The top one - Gregory's voice, you assume - looks down nervously at the other two.
The middle one looks up at you curiously, and the bottom one glares at you in turn.
I-I'm not... really... a personality core. I'm... three of them.
I know I've been trying to hide it, and this is really difficult - no one knows this but my creators, and...
I figured you should know the truth before I ask you to accept me any further.
Accept you?
Well, Doctor... we... have constantly been running into you, and... you treat me - uh, us so well.
No one's done that for us before.
I don't want you to think we're weird, or awkward, but...
Can you give me a chance? To be closer to you?

Oh, Doctor... I...
Thank you. So much.
I don't want to rush things too much between us, so I'm sorry if it came off that way.
Oh no. It wasn't like that at all.
I'm glad.
How does... this work, anyway?
Well, it's a little complicated...
I'd like to know regardless.
I - the one with the yellow eye - I do most of the talking. And appearing, of course.
The one right below me - it does a lot of the thinking. Since we're really small physically, we don't have as much processing power...
We gotta divide our jobs, y'know?
And the bottom one?
It controls the movement - the cart we're on, and our handles, our eyes...
But we can't be separated. From what I know. We'd be incomplete, we'd...
We wouldn't be fully functional.
That sounds hard, Gregory.
It is, but...
Oh shoot! Look at the time! I've gotta get down to Kris!
Can you put the trench coat back on me?
Sure.
You slide the trench coat back over Gregory and fasten it at the top.
Thank you, Doctor.
I'll... see you later, right?
Absolutely.
And they're gone.
How strange.
Oh... I'm sorry, Doctor, I-I know it is a little weird, haha.
Can you... put my trench coat back on me?
Sure, Gregory.
You put the trench coat back over his... "shoulders".
Well... this certainly got awkward quick.
On second thought, I should probably leave. I...
I'll see you later, Doc!
And he's gone.
How strange...
Suddenly, you hear a sound - a faint, but distinct, humming.
A familiar-looking "face" rounds the corner - albeit, a little... different from when you last saw it.
Oh! Doc! Sorry, didn't mean to intrude on your route, I...
Where's that core that's always following you?
Don't know, but... is that really you?
Yep! It's me. I know, I look a little different...
I finally got off my ass and went down to repair to go get fixed.
They almost refused me service! Hah.
Thankfully a little core named Virgil backed me up.
Took a lot of work - 'bout 3 hours, but... I feel better than ever.
You... sound better, too.
Well, it ain't easy... I still got a lot of pain in my chassis, and... y'know...
I'm tryin' to be better.
'Cuz, well, Doc...
I really wanted to prove to ya that I'm more than what I look like.
Now, s'true, I've been on a downwards spiral for years now...
Hell, I can't even remember my own name...
But I really hope that doesn't dissuade ya.
I'm tryin' to be better. Fixing myself up like this... that's my proof to ya, Doc.
You've been awfully patient with me. Through my flirtin' and everything...
I wanna keep... what we have... goin'.
Whaddaya say?

Well then...
I'd consider myself one lucky guy.
I can't believe you went and fixed yourself up just for me.
Well, it wasn't all for you, y'know.
Some of it was for myself, too.
Can't stay like that forever...
But yeah. Mostly you.
You said you can't remember your name? At all?
Yeah, that's right. I haven't been attached to the system in so long, I don't even know when I was activated...
I'm sure the memory's somewhere deep in my systems, but...
I've yet to reach it.
That must be hard.
Sometimes. I don't know how to introduce myself...
So I jus' don't.
Fair enough.
Now, Doc, I have a feeling you're runnin' late, so you should prolly get on your way...
But don't worry. You'll see me later for sure.
Can't wait.
See ya, Doc.
And he's gone.
How interesting.
Well... no worries. I get it.
I'm a better man. I can take rejection.
Sorry, it's just -
Nah, Doc, I understand. Don't feel guilty.
I can improve myself for me, y'know.
Anyways, you should get goin'. I can tell you're kinda in a hurry.
I'll see ya around.
And he's off.
The walk up to the greenhouse is incredibly long and boring.
I wonder where she went...
Eventually, you reach Aspen's door. You open it carefully.
Doctor! You're late today...
Yeah. Miss Esther didn't show up, so I didn't really know what I was supposed to do.
Strange...
Are you okay? You seem awfully concerned.
Yeah, I'm okay, but...
There's something in the air. The plants are quiet... too quiet.
Quiet?
Yeah. Usually they make this soft, gentle sound - you'd know if you spent all day with them...
But today... they're silent. No crying, no singing, no laughter...
Silence.
Huh.
They usually sound even more beautiful when you're here.
They tend to like the same things I do! Haha... uh...
But yeah. Nothing.
Is that a bad thing?
Not necessarily bad, just... interesting. I don't know.
It's so good to see you, though. I'm glad you came back after... yesterday, haha.
Why wouldn't I have come back?
Oh, I don't know. I get worried like that.
Don't worry, Aspen. I'm not going anywhere.
Good.
You should be going, though. A-As much as I'd love to keep you, you are behind on schedule, haha...
Yes, you're right, Aspen.
I hope the plants... feel better.
Me too.
I'll see you tomorrow, Aspen.
Same to you, Doctor. Hah.
You finish your checklist on Aspen and leave the room.
Is everything alright in here? You seem awfully concerned.
Yeah. Well, everything's physically fine, but...
There's something in the air. The plants are quiet... too quiet.
Quiet?
Yeah. Usually they make this soft, gentle sound - you'd know if you spent all day with them...
But today... they're silent. No crying, no singing, no laughter...
Silence.
Huh.
Is that a bad thing?
Not necessarily bad, just... interesting. I don't know.
It's good to see you, though.
I'm glad there's at least one constant in my daily routine.
I can imagine the stress of maintaining these plants could get to someone.
Sometimes, yeah. But I enjoy it regardless.
That's good, Aspen.
You should be going, though. As much as I like the company, you are behind on schedule, haha...
Yes, you're right, Aspen.
I hope the plants... feel better.
Me too.
I'll see you tomorrow, Aspen.
Same to you.
You finish your checklist on Aspen and leave the room.
Is everything alright in here? You seem hesitant today.
Well, there are some concerns I have about the plants...
But that's completely natural. It's my whole job to be worried about them! Haha.
If you say so.
Everything's pretty much fine in here, though. No issues with my systems, which is what your real concern is, anyways.
True. That is my main priority.
Since you are behind on schedule, though, you should probably get going.
Yes, you're right. I'll see you tomorrow.
Thank you, Doctor.
You finish your checklist and leave the greenhouse.
The walk back down to the main section is uneventful.
After what feels like forever, you finally reach the door to CC's room.
You gently open the door.
You find CC looking at you expectantly.
Doctor? Where is Miss Esther?
She didn't show up this morning. I have no idea where she is.
Interesting. That's very unlike her.
That's what everyone's said so far.
Regardless, it's... good to see your face.
As you're well aware, it gets lonely in here. I was worried you weren't coming at all.
Nonsense. I have a job to do.
And of course, I want to see you.
I'm so glad. You are too kind to me, Doctor.
You deserve it, CC. How are you feeling today?
Terrible. The worst I've ever felt, I...
It's hard to talk about, I understand.
Yes. I know you do.
I was talking to that core, the damaged one that you apparently keep bumping into...
Wasn't he in your room the other day?
Yes. We've been talking a lot recently.
Honestly, sometimes I'll sneak him in here so I have some company...
Sounds like you guys are getting along well.
Yes. He's kind. And he's been... trying to get better.
That's great to hear.
Isn't it?
I only wish I could say the same about myself.
Now... Doctor. You're very behind - I'm assuming due to Miss Esther's absence, but - you should be going, now.
Yes, CC, you're right. I'll see you tomorrow?
I hope so.
You finish your checklist, gently touch CC on the... "cheek", and leave his room.
Regardless, it's good to see you. I was worried something had happened.
Well, technically something did, but... I have a job to do.
Very true.
How are you feeling today?
Terrible. The worst I've ever felt, I...
It's hard to talk about, I understand.
Yes. I know you do.
I was talking to that core, the damaged one that you apparently keep bumping into...
I know who you mean.
Wasn't he in your room the other day?
Yes. We've been talking a lot recently.
Honestly, sometimes I'll sneak him in here so I have some company...
Sounds like you guys are getting along well.
Yes. He's kind. And he's been... trying to get better.
It certainly looks that way. I saw him earlier. It's good for him.
That's great to hear.
Isn't it?
I only wish I could say the same about myself.
Now... Doctor. You're very behind - I'm assuming due to Miss Esther's absence, but - you should be going, now.
Yes, CC, you're right. I'll see you tomorrow.
Yes.
You finish your checklist and leave the room quietly.
You're late today - I was concerned you might not show up at all.
I still have two more days before my time here is over. I have a job to do, with my supervisor or without.
Mmm. Very true, Doctor.
How are you feeling today?
Terrible. The worst I've ever felt, I...
No need to elaborate. That's all the information my report requires.
Oh, and CC -
I truly hate to rush you along, but you are behind schedule, Doctor. You should be going.
Ah. Yes, you're right. Thank you, CC.
You finish your checklist and leave the room quietly.
Almost done...
You slowly trudge your way over to the gym.
Maybe she'll have sent me an email explaining her absence tonight.
Once again, Rob is yelling at the TV above him.
OH, YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. AM I THE ONLY SMART ONE HERE?
FOR ONCE IN YOUR GODDAMN LIFE, COACH, COULD YOU MAKE A GOOD CALL?
Jeez...
Oh! Doc. Sorry, didn't hear ya come in.
I wasn't even sure you were gonna show at all! You're awfully late.
Say, where's Miss Esther?
Dunno. She never showed up to work.
Really? Huh...
Anyhow! Good to see ya, Doc.
Hope you're taking care of that card I gave you.
Of course I am. I'd treasure anything you gave me.
Aww, you flatter me.
Big mistake! I love compliments.
Who doesn't?
True, true...
But yeah. Everything's working fine in here.
I ain't got any complaints.
Other than that you aren't in here with me.
You flatter me right back, Rob.
I know!
HEY! CAN'T YOU FOCUS? THE BALL IS IN YOUR GODDAMN HANDS, RUN WITH IT!
Oh shoot! It's almost 4, Doc!
Oh God, you're right. I didn't even realize.
You should get goin'. But hey - we'll have plenty of time this weekend, right?
Of course.
Awesome. See ya, Doc.
You finally finish your checklist and head back out to your office.
Anyhow! Good to see ya, Doc.
Everything's working fine in here. Don't got any complaints.
That's good. How's business?
Picking up, actually. Which is fine.
It ain't the best 'cuz I can't yell as much, but it's better than being in here alone all day.
That's good, then.
Aren't you glad people are finally using these machines?
Yeah! Course I am, but -
HEY! CAN'T YOU FOCUS? THE BALL IS IN YOUR GODDAMN HANDS, RUN WITH IT!
Oh shoot! It's almost 4, Doc!
Oh God, you're right. I didn't even realize.
You should get goin'. Don't want you to get in trouble for going over.
Of course.
See ya tomorrow, Doc.
You finally finish your checklist and head back out to your office.
Anyhow!
Everything's working fine in here. Don't got any complaints.
How's business?
Picking up. It's whatever.
Keeps me busy.
Are you alright? You're pretty short with me today, I -
HEY! CAN'T YOU FOCUS? THE BALL IS IN YOUR GODDAMN HANDS, RUN WITH IT!
Oh shoot! It's almost 4, Doc!
Oh, you're right. I didn't even realize.
You should prolly get going, huh?
Yeah. Probably.
Don't worry about anything in here. It's all working fine.
Roger that.
You finally finish your checklist and head back out to your office.
Still no sign of Miss Esther.
You sigh.
Maybe in my emails?
You sit down at your desk and leave your paperwork on top.
With no one to process it, you aren't sure what to do with it...
You enter your chambers for what feels like the 8th time.
...probably because this is the 8th time.
Only 4 more days till you're out of here...

You lay down in your bed for the night and close your eyes.
You wake up at 07:30, ready for the day.
Well, as ready as you can be.
You get dressed and head out the door.
Hello... Doctor.
Miss Esther? Are you okay?
Yes, just... incredibly tired.
How can a core be tired?
I'm not even sure. I just know I'm exhausted for some reason.
Anyways, let's get started on our shift, Doctor.
Yes ma'am.
It takes you no time at all to get to the conference room.
Kris, it's time... for your check-in.
Er, Miss Esther... is everything alright?
She's tired, apparently.
Very much so.
Well. I have good news for you, then - everything's alright in here.
I don't have anything to report today.
The stock is looking better than ever, and I'm running smoothly as well.
Do you want to see how smoothly I'm running, Doctor?
I-I'm okay. Thank you. Haha.
Your loss.
Anyways...
That's great to hear, Kris. I'm glad things are going well.
As am I.
Doctor, I know you have your one-on-one supervising shift tomorrow, and...
...well, I know I can't ask you to choose me, but...
It would be well in your interest to supervise me tomorrow.
That's all I'll say.
Kris... what are you saying?
Nothing, Miss Esther. I apologize.
Always good to see your face, Doctor.
Sunshine on a cloudy day.
...whatever that means.

Well. You should be going. I know you have plenty to do today.
I hope I see you here tomorrow.
Goodbye, Kris. I'll see you later.
You check Kris off your list and leave the conference room.
Ah. Ahem. Thank you, Doctor.
It's most likely because I polished my chassis last night, but...
Um. You should be going. I know you have plenty to do today.
I... hope I see you tomorrow.
Goodbye, Kris. I'll see you later.
You check Kris off your list and leave the conference room.
I'm glad things are going well. That's good to hear.
Thank god, right? Now you don't have to check off a different box than usual.
Such an exhausting task.
Now, Kris, just because I'm tired -
I apologize, Miss Esther.
Haha... truly, I do not know what's gotten into me lately.
Forgive me.
Uh... well, if everything's okay in here, we should probably be going.
Mmm. That's an excellent idea, Doctor.
Have a good day.
You too.
You hesitantly check Kris off your list and leave the conference room.
I apologize for not being my... usual self, Doctor.
I hope this shift goes by quickly.
Doc! And...
...Miss Esther, yeah?
Shocker bumpin' into you two here.
Shocker?! You're in the way of our route.
Not that much of a surprise that we're doing our job on a Tuesday morning, is it?

Oh, uh... you too, Doc.
Sorry you ain't seen me yesterday, I uh... I was busy.
Glad I bumped into ya now, though.
Ugh. Doctor, can we move on? Please.
Ah, yeah, sorry, should prolly get out of your way, but...
Hey Doc, if you see me later, I got something important to tell ya, alright?
L-Later though, not now, hah.
Alright. I'll keep that in mind.
Catch ya later. Hopefully.
Ah, yeah, sorry, should prolly get out of your way.
I'll catch ya later, Doc.
Agh, sorry, yeah, I'm movin'.
Jeez, you're real rude.
See ya, Doc.
Ah, thank god. That core annoys me to such an incredible extent, I...
Oh, we're here.
I forget how close Kris and Heath are to each other...
Doctor! I've got another trick for you today!
...and I'm not putting myself in danger this time!
She turns around briefly, then turns back with four metal rings hanging from her handles.
Now... pay close attention.
You see here - all four rings are connected, yes?
Yes.
Are you so sure about that?
With an upwards flick of her handle, the rings seem to disconnect from one another mid-air -
And by the time they land back down, they're split into two and two.
TADA!!
Just a little... sleight-of-handle.
Wow! That's incredible, Heath.
Yes, yes, I know, I know, haha.
You're always my best audience, Doctor.
Now, I know you have places to be - but hear me out for one second!
You have your one-on-one shift tomorrow, yeah?
If you choose me, I have a very special show to put on for you!
No pressure of course, but...
Heath... watch yourself.
Aha, yes, Miss Esther. Anyways, Doc, I hope you'll stop by to see it!
You definitely pay more attention than the last guy did! Hahaha.

Doctor...
Oh - ahem. Well...
That must make me the best magician EVER!
Or you meant it, as in like, I'm annoying...
...but I don't think you did.
Glad I can bring a smile to your face, Doctor!
Doctor, we should continue our route, now.
Ah, yes. You should leave!
I'm sure I'll see you tomorrow!
Thank you, Heath.
You check Heath off and leave the break room with Miss Esther.
Ah, true. He really didn't care much for me, haha.
Which is why I'm glad you're here! If only temporarily.
Now - Miss Esther's giving me that look, Doc... y'know, the "shut up before I yell at you" look?
So you should probably be going.
Great power of observation, Heath.
Yes, we'll be going now. Thank you, Heath.
You check Heath off and leave the break room with Miss Esther.
I genuinely don't know how you did that.
I know you feel this is a waste of time, Doctor, but this is my passion.
Forgive me if I can't resist the urge to show off!
As you can see, though, everything here is working just fine.
I know you have a schedule to keep, so...
...Yes, I'll be going.
Wonderful! I mean...
Have a great day, Doctor!
You check Heath off and leave the break room with Miss Esther.
You know, running along these management rails all day takes a lot more out of me than you might think...
I still can't understand how you get tired.
As I've said, I'm not sure either. Perhaps it's something Aperture programmed into us, to make us more...
..."human".
Frankly, I don't see the appeal of being human...
Other than the legs, of course.

See! There's the spirit.
Ugh. I can't put in that much energy right now.
That's good, I suppose.
Sorry if I seem a little... off today, Doctor.
I really can't put in that much energy today.
Before you know it, you've reached the greenhouse upstairs.
I'll just be out here... resting my optic.
You enter the greenhouse.
Everything seems to be normal from the outside.
You're well aware by now, of course, that the only person that could tell something is off would be -
Aspen? I'm here for your check-in.
Aspen turns around to face you.
They greet you with a smile. Or something like it.
Doctor! Ah, it's great to see you. How are you?
I'm doing good, Aspen. How are you?
Great! Everything's going smooth. The chrysanthemums I showed you yesterday are blooming even bigger than before.
You know, chrysanthemums are used in tea sometimes, and it's generally believed it has several health benefits...
In addition, they can reduce air pollution in some cases! In small amounts, of course, but...
Oh shoot, I'm rambling again, aren't I?
S-Sorry, Doctor, sorry.

Aha... that's twice in a row now, you've said... something...
...like that.
Doctor, I...
Well, um, uh...
...thank you.
Look, I know I'm not really supposed to ask you this...
And I'm stepping way over my programming here, but...
...If you could, do you think you could supervise me during your one-on-one tomorrow?
I have something... important to tell you.
I'll think about it, Aspen.
Ah, good. I know it's... strange of me to ask, haha...
I-I really don't know what to say to that, haha.
But yes! Everything's working fine. We're all - I mean, I'm... uh.
Well.
As much as I hate to say it, I should probably be going now.
Miss Esther is most likely waiting for me.
Oh! Um. Yes.
Have a good day, Doctor!
I hope you'll choose me tomorrow.
You check Aspen off your list and leave the greenhouse.
Thank you, thank you, Doctor.
I knew you'd understand.
But yes, uh... you have nothing to worry about.
That's good.
I should probably be on my way, then - Miss Esther's waiting for me.
Of course Doctor! I'll see you on Thursday for sure!
You check Aspen off your list and leave the greenhouse.
They greet you with... actually, you're not quite sure what that look is.
Oh, Doctor! Hello again.
Hi, Aspen. Is everything going well in here?
Yes, as usual, everything is fine.
I'm glad to be working in here. The plants keep me company. And they're very kind.
Especially when most people aren't.
Anyways!
You've got nothing to worry about, Doctor! Haha. So you can go.
Uh... alright.
Have a good day!
You hesitantly check Aspen off your list and leave the greenhouse.
Ah. Doctor. Welcome back.
Let's be on our way to CC, now.
You follow Miss Esther as she tiredly leads you on her rail.

She laughs softly.
I'm doing wonderful, Doctor! Simply excellent.
...no, Doctor, I'm not okay. As I said, I'm very tired.
Please... a little silence would be nice.
Ah. Yes. I'm sorry.
Eventually, you two approach the door to CC's room.
You hear... "coughing" from inside. It seems CC is already awake.
You open the door.
Doctor... Miss Esther.
He sounds much... rougher than usual.
Forgive me for my brevity. I am...
He coughs harshly.
...not feeling my best.
CC... you sound terrible.
Haha... yes, I'm aware.

Mmm. Thank you, Doctor.
I know. I appreciate that.
Honestly, how I feel is up and down on the best of days...
I just hope it isn't worse tomorrow.
As do I.
Everything's as it should be, though, Doctor.
You know... seeing you is one of the only things keeping me going right now.
...
Forgive me. That came... out of nowhere.
I am sorry, Doctor.
Don't be, CC. It's alright.
Doctor, we should be leaving - CC needs his rest.
Ah. Yes. Very true.
Please rest, CC.
I will.
Wait - Doctor. Before you leave.
I know it seems quite... boring in here, but...
...if you could choose me for your supervising shift tomorrow, that would be wonderful.
I know it's not my place to ask, but...
We'll see.
Thank you.
You check CC off your list and quietly close the door behind you.
Ah, it's alright.
Nothing I haven't been through before.
Still.
Everything's as it should be in here, though.
I'm worse than usual - that's the only change.
Should be good for your paperwork though, yes?
I guess.
Thank you for your consideration, Doctor.
You should be on your way, though - I know you have a schedule to keep.
Ah. Yes.
Thank you, CC.
You check him off your list and gently close the door behind you.
Miss Esther... Doctor.
He sounds much... rougher than usual.
I am...
He coughs harshly.
...not feeling my best.
Apologies.
CC... are you okay?
Haha... no, but it's alright.
Honestly... I just need some rest at the moment.
I understand, CC. Don't worry, we'll be brief.
I think we have all the information we need, anyways.
We'll be going.
Thank you, Miss Esther.
Have a good day.
You check CC off your list and leave the room.
Oh thank god. Our route's almost done.
I am so ready to crash into my... charging... port.
...I guess that phrase doesn't really make sense if I don't have a bed, huh?
Anyways. Let's be on our way. Quickly now.
Miss Esther advances rapidly on her rail while you try to keep up.
You make it to the gym in no time.
I do hope I won't have a reason to yell at him today...
Go go go go GO GO GO GO GO!! COME ON...
You wait patiently.
GOAL!! YEAH, HAHAHA!
Oh, Doc. Didn't see you there.
Sorry, sorry, haha.
Good to see ya, Doc. How's your shift been so far?
Not bad. Miss Esther's very tired today, so we've kind of been rushing through it.
Essie? Tired?
Was bound to happen eventually.
He turns to Miss Esther.
You work yourself too hard.
Yes, yes... I'm aware.
Anyways, Doc. Real good you're here.
You're the highlight of my day. Other than the game, 'course.
That's sweet. Everything working out alright in here?
Yeah. All the machines are up n' running. I even had someone come in earlier today, which is always a pleasant surprise.
I'm glad to hear that. Keeps you busy.
...and awake.
...Now, I'm not really s'posed to say this, but... before you go...
You should totally come by during your one-on-one tomorrow.
I got a surprise for ya if you do.
Watch yourself, Robert.
DON'T CALL ME THAT!
Anyway. Yeah.
Doctor, are you ready to leave now? I am exhausted.
Oh, yes, Miss Esther. Let's go.

Will do.
You check Rob off your list once more and head back to your office.
Would prefer if I didn't see ya at all, haha.
Wow. Rude.
Anyway. Everything's working fine. Things are normal, you've got nuthin' to worry about here.
GO! GO! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU - oh my GOD...
Now I... I'm sure you have work to do -
Oh no, it's the end of your shift, huh...
Well, an employee is bound to come in here any time now, so... haha...
Y'all should prolly get going.
Alright then.
You check Rob off your list once more and head back to your office.
Alright! Great job, blah blah blah, check your emails...
I'm going to bed. Or... you know what I mean.
I'll see you tomorrow, Doctor.
Rest well, Miss Esther.
You enter your room once more.

You lay down in your bed.
Tomorrow's a big day.
You wake up at 07:30, groggy and tired. Not a good start to what's probably going to be a long shift.
Almost done with this week...
You get up, grab your paperwork, and leave for your office.
Doctor! Good morning. How are you?
I'm alright. You seem to be feeling better.
Yes, much better, haha. Not as tired, for sure!
Alright - you know the drill. Today's the one-on-one observation day.
Unfortunately, every single one of the cores under our section has specifically requested -
- either to me, or to HR -
- that you don't oversee them today.
I don't know what you did to cause that, but...
I'm going to put you with CC today. Since he doesn't have a job to maintain, the shift should go by quickly.
Just try not to be too bothersome to him, alright?
Have a good shift, Doctor.
Who are you interested in overseeing?

Unfortunately, Kris has requested you not supervise him today.
You'll have to choose again.
Heath has specifically requested you not supervise her alone.
You'll have to choose again.
I'm afraid Aspen contacted HR and asked that you not oversee him today.
You'll have to choose again.
CC asked me personally not to see you today, Doctor. I'm sorry.
You'll have to choose again.
Rob asked me not to let you in the gym today, for some reason.
You'll have to choose again.
I don't know how you can stand to be around that man...
None of my concern, though!
I'm sure you remember your way to the conference room - it's just right around the corner, after all.
Have a good shift, Doctor.
Thank you, Miss Esther.
You enter the conference room. Kris turns to you.
Doctor... hello.
Uh... hello, Kris.
I'm glad you chose to supervise me today. I was... nervous. You wouldn't.
Ha. You. Nervous.
I can be.
I was still surprised when Miss Esther sent me the message.
But... glad.
Is that so?
Why yes. I do enjoy your company, you know.
I wouldn't be... treating you like I have recently, if I didn't.
Apologies, Doctor. I'm a little anxious today.
You're okay, Kris.
Listen... I have something to ask you, Doctor.
And it's not what you think it is.
It isn't?
Well, I'm actually not quite sure, but...
...you might...
He sighs.
Whatever.
The scene fades to Kris looking down, offering you a silver watch in a blue box.
This... is for you. It's a watch.
Obviously.
A few years ago, when I was still a consultant, I won employee of the month in my department.
The prize for it was a watch.
I told them, "I don't have wrists - what am I supposed to do with this?"
Well. Now I know.
I've... really been enjoying your company lately, Doctor, and I...
Don't want it to end. Anytime soon.
Your time in maintenance may be coming to an end, but...
I hope our relationship won't.

Oh, Doctor...
I'm so glad.
Well then. Ahem.
Doctor, now that we're... closer...
I suppose you might want to know some things about me.
I'm ashamed to admit it, but I do stretch the truth sometimes in terms of my monetary success...
I am just a core, after all.
I do own stock, and I am quite financially successful, but most of that interest goes right back into Aperture's pocket...
So as of right now, I don't have any funds of my own, really.
That's alright.
I don't want to be dishonest with you, Doctor.
So... what about you?
Well, there's not much to say about me, really.
I'm kind of a homebody... I stay inside a lot.
I got my degree in engineering about a year ago, and got hired here shortly after.
That explains your original position in Manufacturing, then.
Yes. I've always liked engineering.
Well, I'm glad you gave Maintenance a fair shot, then.
The rest of your shift is a little awkward, but nice.
Kris seems incredibly happy...
Though he would never let that slip.
You ask him about the watch he gave you.
I'm not sure of the brand - frankly, I believe Aperture may have made the model, cheap and in-house.
Cave would do anything to save even a penny in the years before his death...
So it makes sense employee rewards were cut back, as well.
I'm surprised I even recieved anything in the first place, haha.
And now it's in your hands.
I'll treat it well, Kris.
Hopefully as well as you treat me, aha...
Eventually, the time comes for you to leave.
It's almost time for my shift end, Kris. I should be going.
I'm sure Miss Esther is waiting.
Yes, I...

You lean over to him and gently kiss him on the chassis.
Doctor!
W-Well then. Yes, you should be going, I...
Ahem. Have a good night.
You too, Kris.
You finish your checklist quickly and leave the conference room, and Kris, behind.
Goodbye, Kris. I'll see you tomorrow.
Yes. I'll see you tomorrow, Doctor.
You finish your checklist quickly and leave the conference room, and Kris, behind.
Well then. Ahem. I'm... sorry for assuming things, Doctor.
You can keep the watch. I obviously have no use for it, haha.
I hope this won't sour your opinion of me.
No, it's alright, Kris. I understand.
I'm just...
You don't have to explain yourself.
I am aware what I just asked was... a difficult question.
The rest of your shift is a little awkward, but it goes by quickly.
Kris seems a little uneasy and nervous...
Though he would never let that slip.
You ask him about the watch he gave you.
I'm not sure of the brand - frankly, I believe Aperture may have made the model, cheap and in-house.
Cave would do anything to save even a penny in the years before his death...
So it makes sense employee rewards were cut back, as well.
I'm surprised I even recieved anything in the first place, haha.
Eventually, the time comes for you to leave.
It's almost time for my shift end, Kris. I should be going.
I'm sure Miss Esther is waiting.
Ah, yes. Thank you for your time, Doctor.
And... I apologize. For earlier.
It's okay, Kris.
You finish your checklist quickly and leave the conference room, and Kris, behind.
Alright! Should be a fun shift, then, at least.
I'm sure you remember the way to the break room. Have a good shift, Doctor.
Thank you, Miss Esther.
You enter the break room to find all the lights turned off - except for one.
The stage is lit up by a spotlight, something you're certain wasn't there before.
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen...
Or... well, I guess it's just you, Doctor...
...to Heath, the Magic Core's, grandest show yet!
The curtains part slightly and Heath comes rolling out on her management rail.
Doctor! Welcome, welcome! Do I have a surprise for you today...
She turns down for just a second, seemingly fiddling with something inside her chassis.
Behold... my magnum opus!
With a sudden explosion of sparkle and feathers, a dove emerges from Heath's chassis.
In its beak, it's holding a perfectly-preserved letter.
TADA! For you, Doctor - a special letter!
You see, this past week and a half has been possibly the most exciting of my life so far...
A captive audience! A caring one, at that!
Someone who doesn't find my... energy off-putting.
And so - with this letter - I ask you one simple question, Doctor...
Ahem.
I've enjoyed my time with you... performing, talking, showing off, of course...
...and I know, soon, you'll have to leave to go back to maintenance.
My question is... um...
...will you please keep coming by to see me, Doctor?
I have so many shows I can put on for you, so many things I want to tell you... I...
I really, really like you, Doctor. Do you... get what I'm saying?

Oh, Doctor...
Thank you, thank you!
I'm so, so glad you do, Doctor.
Aha... I was worried... I was overstepping my place.
Didn't think you'd take a chance on a core - let alone one as energetic as myself!
What can I say? You're entertaining.
Oh trust me... you haven't seen the half of it.
Though, Doctor... there is something you should know about me... that might affect... this.
What's up?
Well - you know how I'm SO GOOD at magic, right?
Actually performing magic takes a lot of quick-thinking skills, quick movements...
Stuff a lot of cores can't do with their natural programming.
When I was being manufactured, the engineers... overclocked my systems.
I'm running about two times as fast as I should be!
Helps with the magic, but...
Here, touch me.
Uh... okay.
You reach out your hand and touch Heath's chassis. It's incredibly warm.
What the... you're burning up, Heath.
Haha, yeah, they forgot to account for that... I'm not cooled properly.
It really isn't an issue - the pain doesn't really bother me at all - but I figured I should let you know.
The pain?
Oh, and don't worry about the letter, haha. They were just props! Nothing in the letter.
The dove, though... don't know where she went...
The rest of your shift is exciting. Heath's natural charm makes the initial awkwardness fade away fast.
She seems incredibly happy. Moreso than usual, even.
You know - even if you and I are - uh, a thing now...
You still don't get to know the secrets behind my tricks!
Eventually, the time comes for your shift to end.
Miss Esther is waiting for me, Heath. I should be going.
Oh, yes. You should. I wouldn't want to keep you too long, haha!
Doctor, I...

You lean over and gently kiss Heath on the chassis. It's very warm, but it doesn't hurt too much.
Oh! Doctor, I - well! Didn't see that one coming!
Looks like I'm not the only one full of surprises, haha.
Have a good day, Doctor!
You too, Heath. I'll see you tomorrow.
You finish your checklist and head back to the office.
Goodnight, Heath.
Oh yes! Goodnight, Doctor. I'll see you tomorrow.
Yes. You will.
You finish your checklist and head back to the office.
Oh, no worries, Doctor. I'm sorry!
I must've read things wrong. That's on me.
It's alright, Heath, I just -
No! No need to explain! You're alright, I understand!
Oh, and don't worry about the letter, haha. They were just props! Nothing in the letter.
The dove, though... don't know where she went...
The rest of your shift is pretty normal, all things considered.
Heath's stage presence makes the initial awkwardness fade away fast.
You know - even if I just, like... revealed my heart to you...
You still don't get to know the secrets behind my tricks!
Eventually, the time comes for your shift to end.
Miss Esther is waiting for me, Heath. I should be going.
Oh, yes. You should! Sorry to keep you, Doctor.
Have a good day, Heath. I'll see you tomorrow.
Yes you will!
You finish your checklist and head back to the office.
Oh, good. I was hoping you'd choose them.
You remember the way - upstairs and on your left.
Yes. Thank you, Miss Esther.
Have a good shift!
You enter the greenhouse and are immediately greeted by Aspen.
Doctor! Hello, I, uh...
Wasn't expecting you today.
And I wasn't... entirely prepared... for you, either.
Hahaha! Ignore me, I'm alright.
How are you, Aspen?
I'm good. Great, even. You're here. And I...
Well, uh...
They sigh.
I've got to get this over with someday, haha... and I'm running out of time to.
What are you talking about?
Umm...
This cactus... it's for you.
I know you're probably tired of my botany facts, but...
This is a Scarlet Ball Cactus - parodia haselbergii.
S-She's easy to care for, as most cacti are...
...but she reminds me of... you and I.
I'm the prickly, hard-to-reach, defensive thorns, but...
You're these beautiful flowers o-on top, bringing light to my darkness.
I'm really sorry if this is me being too... forward, but, Doctor...
I-I really like you. A lot. You've brought more to my life than anyone has... than anything has, and I -
I hope you accept this token of affection from me, and I...
When you leave, I truly hope you don't forget me.

You... oh, Doctor, I...
Goodness. You're something, alright.
This cactus is beautiful, Aspen. Thank you.
You're welcome, Doctor.
What are you going to name her?

That's a great name!
Anyways, Doctor, I-I'm glad you've been... accepting of me, and - my awkward confession here.
It wasn't awkward. It was cute.
I - uh... please stop complimenting me, I don't know how to handle it, haha...
I'm so happy you don't think I'm weird.
Being alone in this greenhouse all day, it... doesn't help my anxiety.
So I'm glad I have you... and I'm so, so lucky.
The rest of your shift is peaceful. As usual, Aspen talks the majority of the time, rattling off facts about all kinds of plants.
Heliotropium arborescens has been my most recent study - the garden heliotrope.
It has these beautiful purple flowers that smell like vanilla... or so I'm told. I can't really smell them myself.
And it's poisonous! That's one thing I love about the plant world...
The most beautiful flowers can also be the most deadly!
Isn't that interesting?
Yes, it is.
Sorry, sorry, I'm rambling again, aren't I?
Don't stop. I like it.
Oh...
Before you know it, the shift has rushed by, and it's almost 16:00.
Aspen - it's time for me to go. I don't want to, but...
Oh no, I understand.
And, Doctor, I...

You lean over and gently kiss Aspen's chassis, avoiding the moss-covered areas.
O-Oh... Oh my goodness. I... well. Doctor.
That was...
Well.
I'll see you tomorrow, Aspen.
I, uh, yes! I'll see you tomorrow.
Have a great night. I'll see you tomorrow.
See you tomorrow, Aspen.
You finish your checklist and leave the greenhouse.
O-Oh. I'm sorry for assuming, Doctor, I...
That's on me.
I hope we can stay... friends.
Of course we can, you're alright.
I'm so happy you don't think I'm weird.
Being alone in this greenhouse all day, it... doesn't help my anxiety.
So I'm glad you're understanding.

Aspen - it's time for me to go.
Oh no, I understand.
Have a good day, Doctor. Thanks for choosing me today.
I'll see you tomorrow.
You finish your checklist and leave the greenhouse.
Oh, good. I was hoping you'd pick him.
I know he's been getting sicker...
I'm sure he'd love the company.
I'm sure you remember your way to the residential district.
Have a great shift!
Thank you, Miss Esther.
It takes no time at all to reach CC's room.
When you enter, you find him staring at the photo you gave him.
When you enter, you find him staring out his window once again.
Hello, CC.
He stays turned away from you.
Hello, Doctor.
Are you alright?
Yes. I am. I just...
He turns to face you.
I have something very important to tell you.
Oh. Alright.
I'm going to phrase it in a particular way, however, as I'm...
...not sure I have the words otherwise.
I wore apathy like armor...
...but cracked every time you looked at me, like I was worth being seen.
Even now I blame timing.
As if clocks are crueler than my own hesitation.
As if... love didn't stand right in front of me -
- and wait with open hands -
- as mine stayed tucked in pockets.
I...
Doctor, you have been so kind to me over the past week and a half, and I...
I've never felt anything like this before.
I feel... energized. Like I'm truly living, like... there's a light at the end of my tunnel.
Please, Doctor. When your time in maintenance ends, I hope our time together won't.
Please stay by me.

Oh. I...
You...
He sighs.
Thank you, Doctor.
...I don't think I can accept this, CC. I'm sorry.
I honestly didn't expect you to... say yes.
Not only am I a robot, not only am I stuck in this godforsaken room...
But I'm so horribly sick.
I hope you aren't simply taking pity on me, Doctor.
Not at all, CC. I do truly enjoy your company.
Thank you.
Your shift continues on slowly. You and CC chat gently, pausing occasionally to let him rest.
Life is an... interesting concept to me.
It's not as easily definable as a lot of the scientists here seem to think...
Me, for example. Am I alive? And on top of that, am I living?
Stuck in this room all day...
That's why I find waterfalls so interesting. And sunlight.
Though I've never seen either, they seem to be almost the epitome of what life is...
I do hope I'll get to see them one day.
I'm sure you will, CC.
Doctor... one of the reasons I asked you the question... now...
When we've just gotten to know each other, I...
I do think my time will be coming to an end soon.
I've only been getting worse. There was that one day I felt a little better, but...
After you put your report in, I think they updated my program.
I'm not supposed to die. I'm an experiment, after all. They can't test on me if I'm dead.
I think they made a mistake, though. Increased the program effectiveness too much.
Oh, CC... I'm so sorry.
That's why I needed you to know how I felt about you.
Before I pass.
You mean if you pass.
I always appreciate your optimism, Doctor.
Before you know it, it's almost 16:00, and it's time to clock out.
You should be going, Doctor. Miss Esther is most likely waiting for you.
Ah. Yes. Thank you, CC.
And...

You lean over CC's bed and gently place a kiss on his plates.
You... are incredible.
Thank you. I... that was lovely.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Yes, you will.
You finish your checklist and head out of his room.
Goodnight, CC.
Goodnight, Doctor. Have a good day.
You finish your checklist and head out of his room.
It's alright, Doctor. I understand.
Please, don't think I will hold animosity towards you because of this.
I hope we can remain friends, regardless.

You should be going, Doctor. Miss Esther is most likely waiting for you.
Ah. Yes. Thank you, CC.
You finish your checklist, say goodbye to CC, and leave his room.
At least you'll keep him entertained.
Just try not to yell at him, alright?
I'm sure you remember the way to the gym.
I do. Thank you, Miss Esther.
Doctor! It's good to see you again.
Glad you chose me for your one-on-one - I promise I won't be too much of an annoyance, haha.
Or I'll try. No guarantees, actually.
Hey Rob. Good to see you alive and active.
As usual!
So - come to work out, or...
Actually... there's something I gotta tell ya first, Doc.
Really?
Yeah! And I got somethin' for ya. Come up to my desk real quick.
You approach the gym kiosk.
This is my most prized possession - it's an authentic 1988 Topps baseball card.
Jose Canseco. The guy on the card.
It's pretty hard to find baseball cards this far down...
This one was given to me by the guy in the position before ya.
Anyway. I want you to have it now.
Rob... this seems very personal to you.
Yeah. 'Course it is. That's why I'm giving it to ya.
It's important to me. Just like... you are.
Listen, Doc, I ain't gonna beat 'round the bush -
I really like you. I haven't felt feelings this strong since my wife left me! Ha!
So. Anyway.
Wanna go out? Y'know... you n' me?

Hell yeah! You're the best, Doc.
Haha... thank you.
Now that you and I are "official"...
You should prolly know some more about me. And my ex, I guess.
He begins to ramble about his ex-wife, Celine.
She was beautiful, y'know, all orange and stuff...
Orange?
Yeah, like... well, I dunno.
But she was crazy! Yellin' at me for no reason, and she hated when I watched the game -
WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA? ARE YOU STUPID? WHY ARE YOU NOT RUNNING?!
- AND, to top it ALL OFF, that bitch fuckin' cheated on me.
That's terrible.
I know, right?! Anyway.
I'm glad you don't find my... volume too off-putting, haha.
I can be a little much, I'll admit. But I know when to tone it down!
Don't worry, Rob. I like you just the way you are.
Jeez, you really know how to flatter a core...
The rest of your shift is energizing. Rob talks more about Celine, but he also talks about you, too.
You're really somethin', Doc.
Something good, I hope.
Ha! 'Course you are.
He'll also randomly yell at the TV occassionally - but you've come to expect that from him.
Before you know it, it's 16:00, and time to pack things up.
I have to get going, Rob. But... thank you.
No prob, Doc. And - uh. Before ya go...

You lean over - making sure he's not about to go ballistic at the TV again - and kiss him lightly on the chassis.
Doc! Jeez!
Not that I didn't like it, ya just scared me, I uh... didn't see it comin'.
Haha... thanks. I liked it.
Good, because I like you.
You finish your checklist and head out for the night, waving goodbye to Rob.
Goodnight. I'll see ya tomorrow, yeah?
Of course you will, Rob.
Awesome.
You finish your checklist and head out for the night.
Ah, no, Doc, it's alright.
I'm aware I'm not for everyone!
Hell, that's why I have an ex-wife! Ha!
Speakin' of...
He begins to ramble about his ex-wife, Celine.
She was beautiful, y'know, all orange and stuff...
Orange?
Yeah, like... well, I dunno.
But she was crazy! Yellin' at me for no reason, and she hated when I watched the game -
WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA? ARE YOU STUPID? WHY ARE YOU NOT RUNNING?!
- AND, to top it ALL OFF, that bitch fuckin' cheated on me.
That's terrible.
I know, right?! Anyway.
Sorry... went off on another tangent. I meant to say...
I hope this won't, uh, tarnish our friendship, y'know?
Hope you still like me alright and all.
Don't worry, Rob. You're still a good friend to me.
Phew! Thank God.
The rest of your shift is energizing. Rob talks about sports nearly non-stop. You listen patiently.
And in 1977, both the Mariners and the Blue Jays made their debut...
You don't understand half the stuff he's saying. It doesn't bother you, though.
He'll also randomly yell at the TV occassionally - but you've come to expect that from him.
Before you know it, it's 16:00, and time to pack things up.
I have to get going, Rob. But thank you.
No problem, Doctor. I hope you have a good night! I'll see ya tomorrow.
You finish your checklist and head out for the night.
It takes no time at all to reach CC's room.
When you enter, you find him staring out his window once again.
He turns to face you.
Hello, Doctor.
Hi, CC.
As I'm sure you're well aware, I asked not to see you today.
I suppose Miss Esther had no other choice.
That's correct.
Unfortunate.
Please, show me some grace - I'd like silence.
Okay.
The shift goes by slowly, but nothing bad happens.
Generally CC stays quiet, only mumbling to himself every now and then.
He never talks to you directly.
Eventually, 16:00 comes along.
Thank you for the quiet shift, Doctor.
Have a good day.
Will do.
You finish your checklist and leave the room.
Doctor! How was your shift?
It was okay. Quiet. Boring.
That's understandable. Go ahead and finish your paperwork and check your emails.
It was alright. Just like last week's, honestly.
Glad to hear. Go ahead and finish your paperwork and check your emails.
Only two more days to go!
Thank you, Miss Esther.
endtest
You enter your room and change into your pajamas.
You reflect back on the past week,
 thinking...
You crash into your bed, ready for what the weekend could bring.
You wake up at 11:00 today. No need to wake up early.
You get changed, and decide...

You open the door to your room and step outside.
Really? You're going to stay in?
You're staying in today? There's a bunch of stuff I programmed waiting for you outside!
Lots of dialogue and character interactions and easter eggs and fun stuff!
You're sure you want to stay in?

Good choice.
You open the door to your room and step outside.
You come up to the office door.
You try to open it, but it's locked.
Miss Esther must've locked it up behind her.
You remember the email that mentioned keeping research supplies "locked" over the weekend.
I guess she took it literally...
You leave the office behind you.
You enter the cafeteria. You haven't actually been in here yet.
Even though Miss Esther mentioned it to you on your first day, you've been surviving off old protein bars and granola...
It doesn't look like this place has much better.
Gelatin... agar...
What is this?
A weird, half-solid, half-liquid texture you've never seen before greets you at the buffet.
 You...
Not gonna risk it.
You exit the cafeteria before your curiosity gets the better of you.
You pick up a paper cup and a spoon, scooping the weird gloop into it.
You open your mouth and -
Oh. It's not that bad, actually.
Kind of tastes like strawberries.
You shrug, toss out the cup, and exit the cafeteria.
You come up to the door to Biology.
It's right across the hallway from the greenhouse.
Though you're not allowed in, there's a window on the door you can look through.
Inside, you see what looks like a regular research laboratory - petri dishes, microscopes, test tubes filled with colorful liquids...
You're glad you don't have to worry about all this.
You leave Biology behind.
You come up to the large door that reads "AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY".
From what you've heard, this is where they keep test subjects in stasis.
You open the door.
Oh! Hello. What are you doing in here? You're not a test subject.
This place is kinda off-limits to... normal... people. Or... not normal, necessarily, or...
You know what? Nevermind. It's fine.
Who are you?
Oh, me? Ah, yes, name's Wheatley, that.
It's my responsibility here to tend to all these humans in here...
Not easy, let me tell you, no way, haha.
You, uh... really shouldn't be in here, though.
They might think you're supposed to be on ice right now, and you don't want that, because then they'll...
Well, yeah.
Sorry, I was just wandering the facility.
Well, careful you don't wander into an incineration chute! Hahaha.
Okay, go, go, before they find out someone's in here.
You quickly exit the relaxation center.
You come up to the door that you assume leads to your old workplace.
You don't recognize this entrance, but your office in Manufacturing was on the west side.
What Miss Esther said yesterday is probably correct - Manufacturing is really just that large.
You try to open the door, but it's locked shut for the weekend. No windows to peer into, etiher.
Dejected, you leave Manufacturing behind.
You come up to the door that reads "STASIS RECOVERY BAY" on a plaque next to it.
Not wanting to disturb anything that might be happening inside, you peer through the window.
There's two doctors standing next to a woman with black hair in a ponytail.
They're talking to her. She isn't responding.
It seems like they're inspecting her for testing.
You wonder how many other test subjects are holed up in the Relaxation Center.
When you went inside, it looked like the pods went on forever...
You leave Recovery behind.
You enter into the conference room. Kris is reading something on his screen, and the usual stock market graph is gone.
How are you, Kris?
Oh my, Doctor, you caught me off-guard.
What are you doing here? Doesn't maintenance have weekends off?
Yes, we do. I just thought I'd come visit you.
Oh. Well then, welcome in.
Thank you. How has your day been?
Fine, so far. Not much to do on my days off, so I like to read.
What kind of books do you read?
Mostly philosophy. You humans have some... very interesting ideas about life.
I was just reading some Camus.
Camus?
Absurdist philosopher. 1957 Nobel Prize... his work is an inspiration.
Many can't understand him, or his views.
I'm sure you could, though, Doctor.
I'd be interested in hearing more, I think.
Ahem. Well then.
Would you like to join me tonight for dinner in the lounge?
I may not be able to consume anything, but that would leave me free to tell you more.
No pressure, of course.

Wonderful. I'll be there tonight. You can come as well, if you'd like.
I'll keep that in mind.
Thank you, Kris.
Of course, Doctor.
Now, if you don't mind, I should refresh my knowledge for tonight.
You leave the conference room.
No worries. Perhaps another time.
The invite is still open if you decide to change your mind.
Thank you, Kris.
Of course, Doctor.
Now, if you don't mind, I would like to get back to reading.
Ah. Yes. No problem.
You leave the conference room.
Oh. Doctor. What are you doing here?
I just figured I'd stop by and say hello.
I see. You interrupted my reading, Doctor.
Oh.
I'm not very interested in having company at the moment. I hope you understand.
Yes. Alright.
You leave the conference room.
You enter into Section C8's break room. An actual human greets you this time.
Oh, you're that new temp, right?
Uh... yes, that's me.
Cool. Heath's around here somewhere. She's on your route, right?
Yeah.
I'm just about to head out, but she'll be back soon, I think.
He passes by you and leaves the room.
You decide to wait for Heath.
It doesn't take long before she bursts into the break room, out of breath.
Or something like that, having no lungs.
Ahh! Doctor!! Sorry, sorry, uh... one sec.
She's "breathing" very heavily.
I was... in a rush... to get back, I was down at the lounge... signing up for tonight, but I...
...don't... wanna miss... giving a performance in here.
Tonight? What's tonight?
Oh!
Sorry. I've caught my breath, now.
You haven't heard? Once a month, they do an open-mic at the lounge downstairs.
Open mic? Like, comedy? Or singing?
Comedy, mostly, although I usually do some of my signature tricks alongside my jokes.
Aperture? Comedy? I couldn't imagine those two words combined...
Ah, yes. It's mandatory, I think, orders from up top or something.
I know Miss Caroline has put in a lot of employee morale programs, which might have something to do with it...
Anyways, uh, Doctor, you should come watch!
It'll be fuuuun!

Great! Yes, I'd love to see you in the audience.
Now, I hate to say goodbye, but I've got to practice my tricks, and you'll be spoiled if you watch!
Oh! Yes, I'll be going.
You leave Heath behind to practice.
Oh, yeah, no worries. I'm sure you'll make it if you can!
Now, I hate to say goodbye, but I've got to practice my tricks, and you'll be spoiled if you watch!
Oh! Yes, I'll let you practice.
You leave the break room behind.
Oh... Doctor. You're here.
Isn't... today... your day off?
Yes, but I thought -
I've got to practice for tonight, so... if you could leave, that would be helpful.
Ah. Yes. Alright.
You leave the break room. Heath seems to be in a bad mood today...
You make your way through the residential block, towards CC's room.
You hope you're not disturbing him.
Once you reach his door, you listen closely.
Doesn't seem like there's anyone else in there.
You open the door carefully.
Mmm... hello?
Sorry, CC, I didn't realize you were sleeping.
Oh, don't worry, Doctor, I wasn't.
Just closing my optic for a short while, that's all.
Isn't Saturday your day off? Why are you here?
I just came to see you.
That's a little silly. You don't have any reports to do today.
I don't need reports to come visit.
Haha... fair enough.
It must get boring here on the weekends, since your management rail is cut off.
Yes, very much so.
When I was... first activated, they had a portable rail with everything I needed on it...
A large canister on the back that my tubes could be inserted into, to sustain me.
I'm not sure where it went, but... it allowed me to tour the facility, for a short while.
And you have no idea where they might have taken it?
Oh, it's probably somewhere in the area. Perhaps in a storage unit, locked away...
But yes, I'm not entirely certain.
That's unfortunate, CC. I'm sorry.
No worries, Doctor. I'm fine where I am.
Doctor... perhaps, could you come back tonight? I may have something for you.
But I need time alone to prepare it.
I'm glad. Thank you, Doctor.
Now - you should go. I need to prepare...
Oh. Yes. Thank you.
You leave CC behind in his room.
Oh, no. I understand, Doctor.
I apologize.
Now - I believe I need some rest.
Oh. Yes. Thank you.
You leave CC behind in his room.
Oh... Doctor. What are you doing here?
I just came by to see hello.
I'm sorry, but... I'm not sure I want to see you right now.
Please leave.
Ah... yes. Alright.
You quickly leave CC's room.
You approach the sliding door with the label "EMPLOYEE LOUNGE".
This door looks much different from the others - newer, and the label isn't as large.
Gregory said he'd be in here.
You enter.
The place is vibrant. Soft jazz plays over speakers above you and there are many employees milling about.
The room itself is warm and inviting, gentle wooden brown and deep red brick.
It's nothing like the rest of Aperture. It feels like you've just stepped into a different world.
On your left, a stage with dark blue curtains looms over the lounge.
That's probably where Heath will be performing tonight.
On your right, a bar. Gregory is... "sitting" at one of the stools.
You go over to greet him.
Ahh, Doctor! Glad you could make it. Sit down for a bit, yeah?
You sit down next to him.
So... want a drink?
I don't know what you humans consume, but... I'm guessing it's not lighter fluid.
No, haha, that would kill us.
Well. Most of us.
Well, I think they have a lot to choose from, so...
You havin' anything, Doc?

Aww, that's a shame. But I guess it's not for everyone.
The greenhouse doesn't grow oranges. Is apple juice okay?
Yes, that's fine.
I think so. Gimme a minute.
Thanks.
Anyway, the reason I invited you out, uh...
You've probably been hearing some things... from Rob, from Miss Esther...
That I'm pretending to be something I'm not, I guess?
And I wanna clear things up.
Pretending to be something you're not?
Yeah! Like, the trench coat, for example, it's...
It's just a fashion statement, y'know? Makes me... stand apart from other cores.
He laughs nervously.
I-I'm not hiding anything under it. And I'm CERTAINLY NOT three different cores, in secret.
I can uh... I can guarantee you that much.
I'm not sure where Rob got that idea from, but...
So please, uh...
Don't think I'm weird, Doctor.

O-Oh. That's... that's great to hear. Umm...
So... anyways. What do you like to do... in your free time?
My free time?
I don't really have a lot of it...
After work, I guess I just go right to bed.
Doesn't maintenance only get off work at 4, though?
That's still lots of time to do other stuff!
I guess. I never really thought about it.
What about you?
Me?! Uh... um. No one's asked me what I like before, so, uh...
I guess I like sports a little. Rob tells me a lot about them, and they seem interesting enough.
Have you seen Heath's magic tricks? I like those too. Real impressive.
I guess I'm kinda just a people person. In a way. Not to say I'm... people. But.
I just... really like getting to know everyone here in Aperture.
I'm still a fairly new core. I was only activated about a year ago, so... I still got a lot to learn.
And the best way to do that is by meeting new people!
That's great, Gregory.
Oh - wait a minute -
Gregory looks down and begins speaking softly.
No, I need you to go closer!!
Less left, more right! Come on!
T-They're looking at us, we need to move!
I'm so sorry Doctor, can you give me just a minute?
What are you doing down there?! Activate the panel!
Suddenly, Gregory lurches closer to you. You back up a bit.
S-Sorry, Doc, hard to... control my speed.
How do you move without a management rail?
Oh, quite simple really. There's a - uh, a panel below me that I'm connected to. The cart carries me around.
The engineers just - forgot to install my rail attachment system, so... they had to make do, y'know?
Anyways. I should get going, Doctor. It was nice chatting, and... all that.
And with that, he's gone.
You get up and head out of the lounge.
You enter into the greenhouse with caution, making sure no other employees are here to yell at you.
The lights are back to normal, thankfully, and most of the plants look fine.
Aspen's in the corner, meticulously mending to a flowering species.
Aspen?
AAH! Doctor! Oh please, don't scare me like that!
I-Isn't today your day off? What are you doing here?
I just figured I'd stop by and make sure everything's okay in here now.
Oh, oh, yes! You must've sent that email to Facilities - everything's back up and running!
Thank you, thank you, uh...
I'm so sorry. I really didn't expect anyone else to be in here.
I'm the only one that stays over the weekend.
Really? Doesn't this place take a lot of work to maintain?
Only when the specimens are constantly being tested on.
Over the weekend, none of the scientists are here...
...and the plants are happy. It's peaceful.
They have feelings, you know, and - not that I don't get it...
But sometimes I wish they wouldn't test on them so much.
I understand.
I feel like Bertha is trying to tell me things sometimes.
See, I knew you'd get me.
Say, uh, Doctor...
You normally aren't here when this happens, but...
We have a sample of dinoflagellates in the lab for the next few days.
It's a bioluminescent algae - they emit this beautiful blue-green glow in the dark.
If you'd like, and you're not busy, would you like to stop by during the artificial night cycle tonight?

Oh, wonderful, wonderful, haha.
You should leave now - staying too long could get you in trouble.
I don't want that.
Oh. Yes, I'll leave.
I hope I... I'll see you tonight, Doctor.
You leave the greenhouse and carefully close the door behind you.
Oh, no worries at all. I get it.
There's always another time.
You should leave now - staying too long could get you in trouble.
Oh. Yes, I'll leave.
I hope I'll see you tonight, Doctor, regardless!
You leave the greenhouse and carefully close the door behind you.
Ah, yes. Facilities contacted me personally, so you didn't need to send an email.
Everything's working fine.
I don't think you're approved to be in here off-hours, anyways.
Oh. Yes, sorry. I'll go.
Ah, thank you. I'll see you on Monday.
You leave the greenhouse and carefully close the door behind you.
You enter into the gym. There's actually people in here today, one on the treadmill and one on the rowing machine.
Ah, Doc. Happy Saturday. Come to work out?
Kind of. I also just wanted to check up on you.
Ah, that's kind of you. 'Specially on your day off - you didn't need to come see me.
Yeah, but I wanted to.
Well, then.
Don't flatter me too much now, haha.
I'm getting ready for the big game tonight. Been waiting for this one for a long time...
SuperBowl. Bengals v. 49ers. Technically it aired a few months ago, but...
Aperture's so far down that I'm getting the programming super late.
Not to mention they don't really... prioritize TV here. Obviously.
Hey... you wouldn't wanna join me for that game, would ya?
I probably got a chair 'round here somewhere...
You've seen me yell at the screen all week - now's your chance to join!

Killer! Can't wait. It's gonna be great.
HELLO?? ARE YOU EVEN PAYING ATTENTION? WHERE'S YOUR DRIVE?!
Sorry, sorry.
Yeah, I hope you'll stop in and watch with me.
Now I hate to do this, but I don't want you distracting the other people here, so...
Hop on a machine or head on out.
Ah, yeah. I have other stuff to do, so I think I'll pass, haha.
Ah, no worries. Catch ya tonight, right?
Hahaha. Get it? Catch?
Speaking of -
CATCH IT! CATCH THE BALL! COME ONNNN, COMMIT, COMMIT!
Laughing to yourself, you leave the gym behind.
Ah yeah, got other stuff, prolly.
I get it.
My ex said the saaame exact thing before she started CHEATING on me...
"Can't come home tonight honey, I've got plans..."
YEAH CELINE?? PLANS WITH JEREMY, HUH?? SCREW YOU, WOMAN!
EVERYTHING I DID FOR YOU, AND WHAT DO I GET?
You back out of the gym carefully, leaving him to his ranting.
Check up on me? Why, have I done something wrong again?
No, it's just -
Listen, Saturday's my busiest day. Still not a lot of people, but more than the usual zero.
I don't really got time to chit-chat, so -
KICK IT! KICK IT, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR, YOU HAVE A PERFECT SHOT!
- so either you're here to use the machines or not.
I think I'll just leave, then.
Pfft. Don't blame me when you wither away at 40!!
You back out of the gym before Rob gets any angrier.
You walk down one of the residential block's halls.
The coordinates that core sent you for his "place" lead to the end of this hallway.
You reach a door that looks like it's been abandoned for who-knows-how-long.
You knock.
The door slides open and you-know-who greets you.
Who's... who's there?
Doc? That you?
Yes, it's me. Glad to see you sent the correct coords.
Mmm. Come on in.
Welcome to my... humble little abode. Can I get you a drink?
He wasn't kidding - the closet is unusually large, about the size of a bathroom.
One wall holds a charging port while the other is filled with empty lighter fluid bottles.
The place is a mess.
There's trash on the floor, and dust everywhere.
There's also something in the corner.
You cough.
Doc? You alright?
Y-Yeah, it's just really dusty in here.
S-Sorry, it's been a long time since I've had a human in here...
I'm not attached to the system, so I can't call for janitors.
It's alright. And no, I don't need a drink.
I already got one from the lounge.
Your loss, kid, but.
Thanks for stoppin' in. Long time since I had company.
You look around the room again. The figure in the corner catches your eye.
Hey... what's that?
Oh, that thing? It was stuffed in here when I broke into the place. Weird canister on the back.
When you unfold it, it kinda looks like a wheelchair.
You pick it up and open it. On the back, there's a label - "C.C.T.V."
CCTV? Like... surveillance system?
Same acronym, but I don't think so... mind if I take this?
Sure, I don't care.
Thanks.
You set the CCTV outside for now.
You look around the room again. The shelf catches your eye.
So... lots of lighter fluid, huh?
Uh... yeah. I dunno, I started usin' it, like, I don't know how long ago, but...
I guess I just never stopped.
Why do you use it?
I don't rightly know. I suppose it's 'cuz when I don't drink it every night I start malfunctioning...
Vision gets all blurry... and I got this pounding pain in my chassis, too...
Probably withdrawal symptoms.
With... huh?
You're addicted to the stuff, so your system doesn't know how to function without it.
You haven't always used lighter fluid, right?
Well... yeah. Back when I was... cleaner, and I... remembered my name...
I didn't use it at all...
I... miss those days sometimes.
I don't really even know who I am now. Or where I am half the time.
Hell, just yesterday I'd burst into that poor CC's room and I was such a nuisance...
But it's hard.
I... can't remember. I know it wasn't always like this, but...
I can't think straight much anymore.
I know you're trying. I think you could do it.
Do what?
Quit.
Yeah.
Thanks for inviting me, but I should really get going.
Ah, no, I understand. Have a... good day, Doc. Thanks again for stopping in. And talking to me.
You leave his room and dust yourself off.
The CCTV is waiting for you here - you almost forgot about it.
You pick it up and take it with you.
Doc? Didn't I take away my invite?
Yes, but -
Yes but 'nuthin. Scram. I don't wanna see your face anymore.
Uh -
He slides the door back down in your face.
Guess that was a waste of time.
It's getting late. What's your plans for tonight?
You decide to just head in for the night.
It was fun to explore the facility, though.
You change into your pajamas and head to bed.
You enter into the lounge and look around.
The place is vibrant. Soft jazz plays over speakers above you and there are many employees milling about.
The room itself is warm and inviting, gentle wooden brown and deep red brick.
It's nothing like the rest of Aperture. It feels like you've just stepped into a different world.
On your left, a stage with dark blue curtains looms over the lounge.
That's most likely where Heath will be holding her "performance".
The bartender greets you once more.
Welcome back. Here for the open-mic?
Not really - I'm having dinner with a... friend.
Ah. A friend. The tables are right over that way.
Thanks.
You make your way over to the tables facing the stage.
Kris is sitting in the corner. It seems there's a separate area for cores.
The entire section has management rails coming out from the walls.
Ah, Doctor.
Please, sit. I've been looking forward to this.
You take a seat. There's a plate and a set of silverware in front of you.
You got me utensils?
Ah. Yes. I asked the waiter to set them up just in case you came. I can't... use forks and such, but I'm aware you have to.
I can see you got yourself a can of lighter fluid, as well.
A distilled variant. I don't drink often. Only on... special occasions.
Well, I'm flattered you consider this dinner special.
Of course I do.
What do you think of the lounge? It's fairly new, I believe.
I wasn't in this section when I was activated, but this place wasn't here when I was transferred over.
Not entirely sure when they put it in, but...

Aha, yes, very true.
So, uh... why'd you invite me out tonight?
The scene fades to Kris looking at you, lit by candlelight.
Mmm. Quite simple, Doctor.
You're incredibly intriguing. I don't get to know much about you in our day-to-day.
Plus, it's not like we have much time to chat throughout the week, given your busy schedule.
And, on top of all this, you'll be gone in another week.
I'm simply taking the opportunity I've been given.
You wouldn't fault me for that, would you?
Of course not. And I think it is very kind of you to invite me out tonight, Kris.
I honestly don't leave my room much. Manufacturing is... exhausting.
I'm sure. It must be nice to have a break from that fast-paced environment.
Yes, but Miss Esther still keeps me moving.
She was like that with the last employee, as well.
Whatever happened to my predecessor, anyway?
No one's really quite sure.
He just disappeared one day. No one seems to know what happened.
Come to think of it, though, Beatrice disappeared around the same time...
Beatrice?
Another core that used to be in our section. She managed the swimming pool.
Swimming pool?!
Yes. It's been shut down since she left... I believe they drained all the water, as well.
It's a shame, really. She was very polite.
Interesting.
Enough negative talk, though, Doctor. Let's enjoy ourselves, yes?
The night is exciting - you watch the open-mic performances while conversing with Kris.
You even get to see Heath on the stage, although you're a little too busy with Kris to pay much attention.
Heath even makes a surprise appearance, though you're a little too busy with Kris to pay much attention.
He tells you about Camus' teachings about absurdism. It's interesting.
The night comes to a swift end.
Thank you, Kris. This was incredible.
Of course, Doctor. It was a pleasure.
I... enjoy your company.
Now. I believe my systems are malfunctioning, so I should be going.
I need to check my coolant levels. I think I'm overheating.
Of course.
I will see you on Monday, Doctor.
And with that, he disappears back into the walls behind the lounge.
You get up, thank the bartender and your waiter (even though you didn't order anything), and leave to go to bed.
You enter into the lounge and look around.
The place is vibrant. Soft jazz plays over speakers above you and there are many employees milling about.
The room itself is warm and inviting, gentle wooden brown and deep red brick.
It's nothing like the rest of Aperture. It feels like you've just stepped into a different world.
On your left, a stage with dark blue curtains looms over the lounge.
That's most likely where Heath will be holding her "performance".
The bartender greets you once more.
Welcome back. Here for the open-mic?
Yes, but I'm not performing. Just watching.
You can take a seat at any of the tables over there.
Thanks.
You make your way over to the tables facing the stage.
Kris is at a table on the other side of the room. Seems like there's a specific section that management rails go to.
It's separated from the rest of the "human" tables.
You sit down fairly close to the stage.
After a short while, an employee enters through the curtains.
Welcome, Aperture employees!
Just a reminder that if you are here and aren't an Aperture employee, we do have cause to escort you and/or erase your memory of this facility.
Anyways!
Today is the Saturday open mic, and we have several performers here, some new, some returning.
Please sit back and relax, if you can, and enjoy!
Brought to you by the Employee Morale Program.
The room gently applauds him as he exits the stage.
The first few showcases are interesting, though not what you came here for.
Someone brings a turret onstage and does a duet with it.
Another person shows off an infinite backflip using a portal gun.
Yet another performs slam poetry about feeling trapped in their cubicle.
All in all, it's very interesting.
Next up - Magic Core, Heath!
The room applauds gently once more, and Heath comes out through the curtains.
She approaches the microphone, and a spotlight comes up on her.
Hello, Aperture! I'm glad to be on this stage once more!
Say - I was just in the cafeteria the other day, and - just so you know - I'm allergic to peanuts.
The room is silent. A single cough.
I asked the chef if the cake they were serving had nuts in it - he said no!
When I took a bite, I immediately had to spit it out!
I guess you could say... the cake was a lie!
A single chuckle. You don't get it.
Maybe the joke would make more sense if a human told it?
You know, Aperture was built in a giant salt mine.
I guess they didn't call him "CAVE" Johnson for nothing!
A couple more laughs.
That one was pretty good.
Okay, okay, give me one more chance - this one's a good one.
What does a robot do after a one-night stand?
Silence. Bated breath.
He nuts and bolts!
You laugh. A good bit of laughter fills the room.
Heath looks very happy.
She continues for a bit, and her jokes get more laughter each time.
Eventually, she takes her bow.
Thank you, thank you! I'll be here next week with some more!
Gentle clapping fills the room again. Heath disappears into the curtains.
She suddenly appears out from a wall beside you.
Heath! I didn't know the walls in here were panels...
Haha, yeah, they're disguised as wood, but they're actually hiding a bunch of management rails back here.
So! What'd you think of my show?
I didn't know you told jokes on top of doing magic. I thought you were going to perform some tricks.
Ah, haha, I like to experiment with what I do each time.

Ah, yeah, I'm always a little nervous to start.
You? Nervous?
Don't tell anyone!
I'm glad you liked the show. Thanks for coming, Doctor.
As soon as I came out, I looked around for you. I was so happy to see you in the audience.
Heath, I...
Ah! Hahaha! I should go! Need my beauty sleep!
And I think my chassis is - overheating.
But -
And she's gone.
You get up, compose yourself, and head back to your room to end the night.
You enter into the greenhouse, which much darker inside than usual.
It's almost dead-silent - no hissing of sprinklers or whirring of Aspen's management rail.
It's a little terrifying.
Aspen?
Silence. You wonder if they decided to just call it a night.
Aspen, I'm -
You step forward and look to your left. The door that's usually closed on the far side of the room is now open, and a soft blue light is emanating from within.
You approach the door cautiously.
Aspen?
You step into the room to see Aspen looking down at a water pool.
Manufactured waves ebb and flow across the surface, moving the algae.
Doctor! Glad you could make it.
Isn't it beautiful? Haha.
Wow.
The algae glow a vibrant blue-green light, unlike anything you've ever seen.
I mean, I'm sure you've seen things glow before, but... this is different, yes?
Pyrodinium bahamense. That's their binomial name.
But a lot of us just refer to them as their superclass.
I personally think using their full name can be important...
They're on loan to us from Marine Studies. We generally don't carry much sea life in Botany.
It's a rare treat.
I'm glad you're here.
Aspen, this... is beautiful.
I'm really happy you could make it. I was excited to show you this.
You've shown a lot of interest in plant life, something I'm really passionate about...
I just hope you know that I really appreciate you, Doctor.
I appreciate you too, Aspen. It's been wonderful to learn what little you've shown me.
I'd honestly be interested in hearing even more.
It's such a shame that you're only here for one more week.
I have so much I could tell you...
I promise I'll come by and visit. Then you can tell me as much as you'd like.
No, that can't work. Once you're back in Manufacturing, you won't be permitted to come into the greenhouse.
And I'm not permitted to leave...
Which just means I'll need to take every opportunity I can to teach you!
Under the light of the algae, Aspen begins rattling off about every botany fact they can think of.
It's a lot. How they know so much, you'll never understand.
You suppose it's just the passion they have for the craft.
Before long, you've been here for over an hour, just listening to them.
Oh, uh, Doctor, I'm incredibly sorry, it seems I've kept you here way too late.
Ah, yes. I didn't realize how tired I was until just now, haha.
I know you need your rest and everything, so...
Thank you. Again. For visiting me. It's always... so good to be with you.
I can't wait to see you again on Monday.
Likewise.
You hesistate, but leave the greenhouse behind and head to bed.
You approach the door to the gym. It's mostly dark through the window, although you can see a faint light through the frosted glass.
On the door is a sign that says "CLOSED FOR REPAIRS".
Yeah, right.
You knock.
Uh, sorry, we're closed!! The sign?? Hello?
Rob, it's me.
Agh!! Doctor! One sec, one sec...
There's a bit of light crashing before you hear the whirring of a door lock.
Should be open now, come on in!
You open the door and step in.
Just like you thought, the faint light you saw from outside the window was, in fact, the TV.
Glad ya came, Doc. I was just about to start the game.
Take a seat! Take a seat.
You sit down and look up at the TV.
I've been meaning to ask why your TVs are in such a weird aspect ratio.
Isn't that the same size most of the new monitors are?
Ah, yeah. The boss wanted this newly-invented "widescreen" put into everything - our TVs, monitors...
That man loved anything with "science" in it...
Another reason barely anyone comes in here. Everyone's too obsessed with science thanks to that brute.
Well, not everyone. I'm more interested in engineering than whatever they do up in testing.
Prolly why you and I get along so well.
Anyway, the people up on the surface still haven't all switched over to widescreen, so...
...all my programs are still in the usual 4 by 3. Sorry.
Oh no, it's okay.
You hear a click sound, and the playback on the television starts.
Do you want the heavy favorite, the San Francisco 49ers, going for their third Super Bowl win this decade...
...or the underdogs by 7 points, the Cincinnati Bengals, trying to celebrate their 200th year as an American city with their first Super Bowl win?
The announcer welcomes you to the Superbowl XXIII.
Y'know, Doc, I don't think anyone's ever sat down to watch a game with me.
So... in a way, this is kind of a date, huh?
Haha. Maybe.
Well. Hope my temper doesn't scare ya too bad.
Oh - check it out, the game's startin'.
You don't understand a lot about what you're watching, but it doesn't bother you too much.
GO! GO! COME ON, YOU GOT THIS!
Rob's energy is contagious. Before you know it, you've joined in.
YOU'RE ALMOST THERE, COME ON!
HELL YEAH!
Touchdown!!
The scene fades to a dark room lit by a TV screen. Rob turns back to look at you.
Now you're getting into it, Doc.
Never thought you'd be one to yell.
What can I say? You got me pumped up.
Hahaha! I'm so glad. Thanks for joinin' me tonight.
You really didn't have to, but...
S'been a long time since I last had some proper company.
So I appreciate it.
The game's exciting. Rob explains the basics of football to you so you can keep up with what's going on.
Before you know it, the game's over.
YEAH!! 49ERS TAKE IT!
That's my team right there. I've been so hyped for the Superbowl 'cuz they made it all the way this year.
Anyway. That's all, Doc. Game's over.
Aw, that's too bad. I was having fun.
There's always more - you can stop in any time to join me.
Please don't hesitate, Doc. I really enjoy your company.
Yours too, Rob. Your energy's infectious.
Haha! I'm glad.
Welp. I guess I'll catch you on Monday, then.
Guess so.
You get up to leave the gym.
Wait - Doc.
What's up?
Thanks for not judging me. A lot of the other cores... they think I'm too loud. Too crazy...
Hell, my ex-wife left me cuz of that.
Sports are my passion, and she just... couldn't really accept that.
It feels good to have someone who does around now.
Of course, Rob.
Goodnight, Doc.
Goodnight.
You leave the gym and head back to your room.
You approach CC's door. It's quiet. You knock.
CC, it's me.
Doctor. Come in, please.
You slowly open the door.
CC greets you with a raised optic. In between his chassis and his handlebars is a bouquet of red roses.
I hope this isn't too... forward, Doctor.
Aspen assisted me in acquiring the flowers, so... it wasn't entirely my work.
They remind me of you, though. In a way.
Please... accept them.
Oh, CC...
You take the bouquet from between his handlebars.
Thank you, CC. These are beautiful.
I can't believe you went out of your way just for me.
Aha... it wasn't all that easy, especially because Aspen and I can't leave our rooms, but...
We made it work.
Thank you for coming back to see me, Doctor. I was afraid you wouldn't.
Miss Esther is kind, but... I've never had any of the human scientists show me as much grace as you have.
It is truly unfortunate that you will only be here one more week.
I agree. I've really enjoyed my time in maintenance.
Doctor, please... will you stay a little longer?
I could use your company.
Of course, CC.
Thank you.
You spend the evening with CC, mostly in quiet contemplation.
Occasionally, he'll have a thought or idea he brings up to you, but otherwise you sit in silence.
I sometimes feel like my room is in a world separate from the rest of Aperture.
Because I'm so isolated, I rarely see anyone other than Miss Esther and the maintenance attendant.
It feels like I live in my own little bubble.
I understand that.
It's always a little more lively when you visit, though.
Before you know it, it's very late, and you're beginning to get tired.
Please, Doctor. If you're tired, you should go to bed.
Ah. Yes. I should.
Thank you again for coming by tonight.
I will see you on Monday.
You enter back into your room and lay down in your bed.
You set the wakeup time for 11:00, and lay down.
You decide to stay in.
You read, sleep a little, and go through your paperwork a few times.
It's generally fairly boring.
Eventually, the time comes to go to bed.
You set the wakeup time for 11:00, and lay down in your bed.
You wake up to a knocking on your door.
Disruption detected. Automatic waking sequence initiated.
You groan and lean over. The clock reads 09:43.
Who could possibly...
The knocking continues.
You get up, go over to the door, and open it with a sigh.
Miss Esther greets you.
Doctor! Doctor, so sorry to wake you.
...Miss Esther? What are you doing here?
Oh yes, I'm sorry - I was just wondering if you'd be interested in a day out with me?
Nothing terribly formal, simply an invite from a friend.

Oh! Yes. Sorry, sorry.
Give me just a minute.
You close the door and change out of your pajamas, brush your teeth and put on your shoes.
You open the door once more. Miss Esther is still waiting.
Doctor, fashionable as always. Shall we head out?
Yes, I'm ready now.
Excellent!
Miss Esther guides you down the hall, out of residential.
Most parts of recreation are closed on Sundays. I suppose it's to give everyone a day off.
Rob and Heath, for example. They're usually on a 24/7 recreational schedule, but...
Sunday affords them a day off.
That's good.
Anyway, Doctor, I just wanted to invite you out, because...
...well, we don't get all too much time to chat between all the places we have to go during your shift.
This way, we can just talk. You and I.
Uh... yeah.
Where are we headed, anyway?
Oh, just the cafeteria. I figured you might want something to eat.
Ah, yeah. I am kind of hungry.
Great! We're almost there.
You walk into the cafeteria. There's actually quite a few people in here.
There's no other cores besides Miss Esther, although that's to be expected with the mostly human fare.
Go ahead and grab yourself some food. I'll be here in the corner - not a lot of management rails to follow! Haha.
You head over to the buffet-style island in the middle of the cafeteria.
It's not very full - it seems a lot of your coworkers are early risers.
You take a look at the food.
 You decide to grab...
You grab a vegetable omelette and take it with you over to Miss Esther.
I wonder where they get the eggs...
You decide not to question it further.
You scoop some sausages onto your plate.
Need my protein.
This is probably artificial meat, but...
You walk over to Miss Esther.
Something sweet to start the day.
You grab the lemon tart and head over to Miss Esther.
Ah, Doctor. Find something you like, I presume?
Yes, I did.
Haha. Good, good.
So... how was yesterday?
Oh, I just stayed in my room and read some books.
Nothing much happened, honestly.
You had a whole campus to explore, and instead you decided to stay inside?
Well then.
Fair enough.
I explored the campus a little. Just wandered, honestly.
Fun! I'm glad you got out, Doctor.
Did you leave the section at all?
Not really. I'm kind of a homebody, so that's sort of out of my comfort zone.
Fair enough.
Doctor... I have something important to tell you.
Please listen carefully.
Uh... yes. I'm listening.
Do not get too close to the cores in your section.
It is against your contract to form strong relationships with them.
Of course, friendly banter, speaking outside of working hours... that is fine.
But any more than that and it may become an issue.
It won't turn out well for you.
Do you understand?
Uh...
Yes. I understand, Miss Esther.
Great! I'm glad we got that sorted out.
Anyway, sorry for dragging down the mood...
Miss Esther suddenly goes back to her normal self.
She speaks to you about her work and how she became a Supervisor Core.
One of many, she says, though you find it hard to believe there's truly that many at Aperture.
Supervisor Core XA3. That's me.
X-A-3?! You number all the way to the end of the alphabet?
Well, many of those codes are being used for other arbitrary reasons, but...
Yes, generally, we do. Or we did.
I'm not quite sure exactly how many of us are actually still Supervisor Cores, but...
That's neither here nor there.
Eat! What are you waiting for?
Uhh... I've kind of lost my appetite.
Oh, that's not good. I hope that wasn't my fault.

Oh. I'm sorry, Doctor.
Fair enough!
Anyways. Your work is going incredibly well. Management seems to be happy with your reports.
Well, to be honest, the work isn't very hard.
True enough, though it's one of the few jobs they only want a human to do...
A robotic supervisor is fine, but apparently I'm not effective enough on my own.
Interesting.
Thinking about it, though, we do sometimes tend to have a... bias towards members of our own species.
I suppose it only makes sense to have a robot-human team working together...
It's a good thing I like you, then, right?

I'm glad.
Yes, I suppose so.
You clear your throat and get up to put your plate away.
Thanks for inviting me out, Miss Esther, but I'm incredibly tired.
Oh yes, absolutely. Please get some rest.
Work starts again tomorrow, after all!
See you then, Doctor.
See you then.
You leave the cafeteria and head back to your room.
Oh, Doctor, you're not -
You're not insinuating -
I'm terribly sorry, Doctor, but if you're saying what I think you're saying -
I'm afraid I just can't reciprocate.
For one, I just warned you not to get too close to us...
But more importantly, I just... I just don't feel that way about anything... anyone, honestly.
I am flattered, though. I hope this won't make working together difficult.
No, I understand, Miss Esther. I apologize.
I won't bring it up again.
Thank you, Doctor.
Ah no, I understand. So sorry to bother you, Doctor.
I'll let you be, but...
First...
Doctor... I have something important to tell you.
Please listen carefully.
Uh... yes. I'm listening.
I came here to tell you...
Do not get too close to the cores in your section.
It is against your contract to form strong relationships with them.
Of course, friendly banter, speaking outside of working hours... that is fine.
But any more than that and it may become an issue.
It won't turn out well for you.
Do you understand?
Uh...
Yes. I understand, Miss Esther.
Great! I'm glad we got that sorted out.
Anyways, I'll leave you be now - get some rest for work tomorrow!
Goodbye, Doctor!
Um... goodbye.
And she's gone, as quickly as she came.
Did she really only come to give you that warning?
You feel a chill run down your spine.
You shake it off and think about going back into stasis...
...but for some reason, it just looks so... uncomfortable.
Instead, you decide to try to focus your mind on other things.
You read, sift through your paperwork... not a lot to do when you're holed up in your room like this.
